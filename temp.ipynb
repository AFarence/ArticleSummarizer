       "  'content': 'A federal judge in New Jersey sentenced Moshe Silber to 30 months in prison for his involvement in a\\nbroad mortgage fraud scandal\\n.\\nSilber\\n, 35, had turned himself in three weeks ago for violating the terms of his bond. He faced up to five years after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mortgage fraud in 2024.\\nThe U.S. district court judge, Robert Kirsch, repeatedly said that Silber had committed a “significant crime” and a “significant sentence was necessary.” Silber, a co-conspirator of Boruch Drillman, had teamed up to buy an Ohio apartment building, the Department of Justice said. The group picked up the building, called the Williamsburg of Cincinnati, for $70 million, using a stolen identity, then flipped it to Drillman for $96 million, receiving a $74 million loan based on the second, inflated price.\\nKirsch noted he deemed the fraud significant because of the “layers and labyrinth of chicanery.”\\nThe sentence is shorter than another one Kirsch handed out in the scandal:\\xa0 Aron Puretz, who pleaded guilty last year to one count of wire fraud, got\\n60 months\\n, though his son, Chaim “Eli” Puretz, only\\ngot 24.\\n\\nSilber showed up to the packed court handcuffed, wearing a green jumpsuit with a white undershirt. Dozens of members of\\nhis community\\nwere present. Women read prayer books and cried during the course of the two-hour hearing.\\nIn a surprise twist,\\nMark Nussbaum\\n—\\xa0a lawyer who\\nshuttered his firm\\nin January and is the subject of several civil lawsuits over missing escrow funds —\\xa0showed up to court wearing gold-rim glasses, a modern blazer and tight black pants. He sat with Silber’s family and friends.\\nAs the judge was reading Silber’s sentencing, Nussbaum’s phone went off, and security asked him to leave. (He returned to the courtroom at the end of the hearing.)\\nKirsch observed that Silber had\\nlived the American dream\\n, with cars and jewelry worth $2.2 million, but still decided to commit fraud. He also noted how Silber had an annual salary of over $3 million from his father and from someone named Mr. Hoffman, yet claimed to be “in the red” financially.\\n',\n",

The buyer’s identity had been hidden behind an LLC, which was signed for by Zalman Gottlieb.\\nGottlieb is the financial controller for B&amp;H. Representatives for B&amp;H and Brookfield did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\nThe sale of the 287,000-square-foot office property works out to $523 per square foot.\\nIt’s not clear what the new owner has planned for the 287,000-square-foot building, which is located around the corner from B&amp;H’s iconic store at 420 Ninth Avenue. The retailer was previously reported to have\\nexecutive offices at 440 Ninth Avenue\\n.\\n\\nThe tenants at 333 West 34th Street include the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Sam Ash Music and Godiva Chocolatier. The MTA leases at least 100,000 square feet on a lease that isn’t set to expire until 2035, according to\\nCompStak\\n.\\nB&amp;H originally opened in Tribeca in 1973 and moved into its current store in 1997. The property is owned by the Kibel Company, which purchased it in 1994, according to property records.\\nKnown as the Smith Barney Building, 333 West 34th Street was developed in 1954. SL Green bought the property in 2007 for $184 million and reportedly invested about $26 million worth into it. SL Green sold it to Nicholas Schorsch’s American Realty Capital New York Recovery REIT in 2013 for $220 million.\\nThe owner changed its name to New York REIT and then eventually went into liquidation, selling the property to Brookfield.\\nThe West Side of Manhattan on 34th Street saw a surge of investment as the Related Companies’ Hudson Yards and Brookfield’s Manhattan West started to rise.\\n',\n",

The sale marks 10 percent off the initial price Gregg and his wife, Lisa, sought when it listed in June.\\nThe couple purchased the eighth-floor unit in 2005 for $2.4 million.\\nThe buyers were Elliott Investment Management partner Jason Genrich and his wife Sara, an attorney.\\nThe five-bedroom, five-and-a-half bathroom home on East 82nd Street in the Upper East Side features a living room with a decorative fireplace, a primary suite with two bathrooms and two dressing rooms and a kitchen with a china closet. Two storage units were also included in the deal.\\nGregg and Lisa listed the property in June for $12 million, eager to sell the unit at the prewar property as they continue to wind through a divorce battle that started almost five years ago.\\n\\nA Sotheby’s International Realty team including Juliette Janssens had the\\nco-op listing\\n.\\nRechler Equity, run by Gregg and cousin Mitchell Rechler, went public in 1995 and emerged as one of the tri-state area’s largest real estate investment trusts. Eight years later, the company spun off its Long Island properties into Rechler Equity, an entity with roughly 7 million square feet in the portfolio today.\\nRechler Equity is\\nshopping the Hampton Business District\\nin Westhampton Beach, a five-building, 385,000-square-foot industrial park. Bidding for the campus is expected to top $200 million, which would easily shatter Long Island’s industrial sale record.\\nElsewhere on the Upper East Side this week, Allen Simon — the inventor of the Wee Wee Pad —\\nagreed to sell\\na sixth-floor apartment at 838 Eighth Avenue, which was listed for slightly less than $25 million.

       "  'content': 'The 1.8 million-square-foot office tower planned for 350 Park Avenue is a special case.\\nDuring an earnings call last month, Vornado Realty Trust’s Steve Roth said the project was\\xa0 “isolated, different,” than other ground-up office projects in part because billionaire Ken Griffin is involved. (Griffin’s Citadel is anchoring the tenant and is a partner on the project.)\\nAt the time, Roth said the environment for ground-up development is otherwise so inhospitable that he doesn’t think any other project will get off the ground anytime soon. Of course, RXR, TF Cornerstone and BXP might have something to say about that, given that they plan to break ground on their own\\ntrophy office towers\\nthis year.\\nBut on Monday the Park Avenue project became the first office tower to be presented to the City Planning Commission in recent years. The Department of City Planning certified the project on Monday, kickstarting the monthslong public review of the project.\\nThe project is made possible, in part, by the\\n2017 rezoning\\nof Midtown East, which allowed air rights from landmarked properties to be transferred to non-adjacent sites throughout the district. The development team is buying more than 480,000 square feet of air rights from St. Patrick’s Cathedral and St. Bartholomew’s Church. As part of those deals, the developers are paying more than $30 million to a public Realm improvement fund created as part of the rezoning.\\nThe developers are also seeking special permits to add space for a public concourse and to make other design adjustments, hence why the project has to go through the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure.\\nCorrection:\\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly described the period of time that City Planning has gone without reviewing applications for office buildings, based on information from the agency.\\nWhat we’re thinking about\\n: What City Council races are you watching closely? Send a note to\\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\\n.\\nA thing we’ve learned\\n: The Department of City Planning will begin public review of the Jamaica Neighborhood Plan, a rezoning that is expected to pave the way for the construction of more than 12,000 housing units in the Queens neighborhood over the next 15 years.\\n\\nElsewhere in New York…\\n— U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer postponed several stops on his book tour this week, citing “security reasons” as he faces criticism for voting in favor of GOP-drafted stopgap spending bill,\\nPolitico reports\\n. Schumer was expected to make stops in Baltimore, Washington, New York City and Philadelphia this week to promote his new book, “Antisemitism in America: A Warning.”\\n— A professor is accusing William Paterson University in New Jersey of losing his 380 million-year-old fossils,\\nGothamist reports\\n. Paleontologist Martin Baker is suing the school, alleging that it botched sending the fossils to a colleague in Florida, resulting in the collection being sent to a landfill in Tennessee.\\n— The city plans to build a new NYPD training facility and indoor shooting range on City Island,\\nthe City reports\\n. Residents of City Island have complained over the years about the noise from the shooting range. NYPD representatives say the new facility will result in “almost zero to no noise at all.”\\nClosing Time\\nResidential:\\nThe priciest residential sale Monday was\\n$33.9 million\\nfor a condo unit at 15 Central Park West. The Zeckendorf-developed unit’s last on-market sale was $22.7 million in 2008, though the condo is selling less than its initial listing price of over $60 million.\\nCommercial:\\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\\n$150 million\\nfor 333 West 34th Street. Brookfield was the seller of the Garment District office property, which is 287,000 square feet. Brookfield faces a significant loss on the asset after paying $255 million for the property seven years ago,\\nper reports\\n.\\nNew to the Market:\\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $45 million at\\n10 East 67th Street\\n. The Lenox Hill townhouse is 13,100 square feet and is listed by Serhant.\\nBreaking Ground:\\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 48,902-square-foot, six-story, mixed-use building at 10-39 49th Avenue in Queens.

       "  'content': 'The Wilf family thinks its revamped development can go event bigger in New Jersey as West Orange looks to contribute its fair share of affordable housing.\\nGarden Homes, the development company led by Minnesota Vikings owner Zygi Wilf, proposed building an apartment community of nearly 500 units across four buildings in a forest on top of a mountain in West Orange, Gothamist\\nreported\\n. A previous 136-home plan for the same land was rejected by the town.\\nThe development would include 100 apartments for low- and medium-income residents, which would help West Orange on the path to contributing its fair share of affordable housing, as required under state law.\\nLocal opposition is hitched to environmental concerns and the possibility the retraction of the forestland would lead to worse flooding. Environmental experts fear developing the 120-acre land — the largest undeveloped tract in a densely populated part of the state —\\xa0could also lead to dangers for residents living atop a mountain.\\nWest Orange Township Council president Joe Krakoviak doesn’t support the project, but voted in favor of including it in West Orange’s affordable housing plan in 2020, fearing the possibility of a lawsuit and a loss of control over what is ultimately built on the site through builder’s remedy, a court order that allows developers to bypass town control to build affordable housing.\\n\\nWhen the Wilfs first proposed an initial project in the early 2000s, it was rejected and public safety was the chief reason given. The deputy fire chief testified it would be dangerous and inefficient for both residents and emergency responders.\\nAfterwards, local residents banded together to try and preserve the forest as protected open space, but couldn’t come up with the necessary financing.\\nWest Orange officials and the Fair Share Housing Center kicked off negotiations over utilizing the land in 2015 to work towards affordable housing goals. At the time, the land was analyzed and there was no objection in including it in the town’s settlement agreement, according to a Fair Share director.\\nThe West Orange planning board is set to hold a hearing regarding the project on Wednesday.\\n—\\nHolden Walter-Warner',\n",

       "  'content': 'A federal judge in New Jersey sentenced Moshe Silber to 30 months in prison for his involvement in a\\nbroad mortgage fraud scandal\\n.\\nSilber\\n, 35, had turned himself in three weeks ago for violating the terms of his bond. He faced up to five years after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mortgage fraud in 2024.\\nThe U.S. district court judge, Robert Kirsch, repeatedly said that Silber had committed a “significant crime” and a “significant sentence was necessary.” Silber, a co-conspirator of Boruch Drillman, had teamed up to buy an Ohio apartment building, the Department of Justice said. The group picked up the building, called the Williamsburg of Cincinnati, for $70 million, using a stolen identity, then flipped it to Drillman for $96 million, receiving a $74 million loan based on the second, inflated price.\\nKirsch noted he deemed the fraud significant because of the “layers and labyrinth of chicanery.”\\nThe sentence is shorter than another one Kirsch handed out in the scandal:\\xa0 Aron Puretz, who pleaded guilty last year to one count of wire fraud, got\\n60 months\\n, though his son, Chaim “Eli” Puretz, only\\ngot 24.\\n\\nSilber showed up to the packed court handcuffed, wearing a green jumpsuit with a white undershirt. Dozens of members of\\nhis community\\nwere present. Women read prayer books and cried during the course of the two-hour hearing.\\nIn a surprise twist,\\nMark Nussbaum\\n—\\xa0a lawyer who\\nshuttered his firm\\nin January and is the subject of several civil lawsuits over missing escrow funds —\\xa0showed up to court wearing gold-rim glasses, a modern blazer and tight black pants. He sat with Silber’s family and friends.\\nAs the judge was reading Silber’s sentencing, Nussbaum’s phone went off, and security asked him to leave. (He returned to the courtroom at the end of the hearing.)\\nKirsch observed that Silber had\\nlived the American dream\\n, with cars and jewelry worth $2.2 million, but still decided to commit fraud. He also noted how Silber had an annual salary of over $3 million from his father and from someone named Mr. Hoffman, yet claimed to be “in the red” financially.\\n',\n",

The sale marks 10 percent off the initial price Gregg and his wife, Lisa, sought when it listed in June.\\nThe couple purchased the eighth-floor unit in 2005 for $2.4 million.\\nThe buyers were Elliott Investment Management partner Jason Genrich and his wife Sara, an attorney.\\nThe five-bedroom, five-and-a-half bathroom home on East 82nd Street in the Upper East Side features a living room with a decorative fireplace, a primary suite with two bathrooms and two dressing rooms and a kitchen with a china closet. Two storage units were also included in the deal.\\nGregg and Lisa listed the property in June for $12 million, eager to sell the unit at the prewar property as they continue to wind through a divorce battle that started almost five years ago.\\n\\nA Sotheby’s International Realty team including Juliette Janssens had the\\nco-op listing\\n.\\nRechler Equity, run by Gregg and cousin Mitchell Rechler, went public in 1995 and emerged as one of the tri-state area’s largest real estate investment trusts. Eight years later, the company spun off its Long Island properties into Rechler Equity, an entity with roughly 7 million square feet in the portfolio today.\\nRechler Equity is\\nshopping the Hampton Business District\\nin Westhampton Beach, a five-building, 385,000-square-foot industrial park.

       "  'content': 'Watermark Capital Group secured financing for one of Brooklyn’s notable office-to-residential conversions.\\nWolfe Landau’s firm scored $125 million in construction financing for the conversion of 175 Pearl Street in Dumbo, the Commercial Observer\\nreported\\n. Bravo Property Trust — an affiliate of Bravo Capital — and Integritas Capital provided the debt, which closed a year after BridgeCity Capital originated a $50.6 million acquisition loan.\\nWatermark\\nacquired\\nthe eight-story, 185,000-square-foot office property last summer from Cannon Hill Capital Partners for $66.5 million. Landau immediately embarked on plans to convert the 1918-built property into a 19-story complex.\\nOriginally, the plans reportedly called for a 14-story, 230,000-square-foot building with 238 rental units. Those plans have since shifted, with Watermark eyeing multifamily units on the eight converted floors and an 11-story condo property atop the rentals.\\nCritically, the rental portion of the building will qualify for the city’s 467m program, giving Landau a tax abatement for 35 years in exchange for 25 percent of apartments being earmarked for affordable housing. The abatement provides a 65 percent exemption for the first 30 years before falling to 10 percent annually for the last five years of the abatement.\\n\\nOccupants at the building included Constangy, Brooks, Smith &amp; Prophete, Thelab and coworking company Spaces. But a BridgeCity analyst said at the time of acquisition that all tenants had either departed or were soon to do so.\\nAmenities are expected to include tenant lounges and a fitness center. Watermark expects to complete the conversion in 2027.\\nLast summer, Williamsburg-based Watermark\\nsubmitted a proposal\\nfor a residential project on the site of a shuttered church in Greenwood Heights. The 218-unit project requires a zoning change from the district’s light manufacturing zoning status to residential.\\nIn June, the firm paid $15 million for Brooklyn’s Hanson Place Central United Methodist Church in Fort Greene, while in late 2023, Watermark paid $12.3 million for St. Lucy’s-St. Patrick Roman Catholic Church in Bedford-Stuyvesant and demolished it to make room for housing.\\n—\\nHolden Walter-Warner\\n',\n",

(Griffin’s Citadel is anchoring the tenant and is a partner on the project.)\\nAt the time, Roth said the environment for ground-up development is otherwise so inhospitable that he doesn’t think any other project will get off the ground anytime soon. Of course, RXR, TF Cornerstone and BXP might have something to say about that, given that they plan to break ground on their own\\ntrophy office towers\\nthis year.\\nBut on Monday the Park Avenue project became the first office tower to be presented to the City Planning Commission in recent years. The Department of City Planning certified the project on Monday, kickstarting the monthslong public review of the project.\\nThe project is made possible, in part, by the\\n2017 rezoning\\nof Midtown East, which allowed air rights from landmarked properties to be transferred to non-adjacent sites throughout the district. The development team is buying more than 480,000 square feet of air rights from St. Patrick’s Cathedral and St. Bartholomew’s Church. As part of those deals, the developers are paying more than $30 million to a public Realm improvement fund created as part of the rezoning.\\nThe developers are also seeking special permits to add space for a public concourse and to make other design adjustments, hence why the project has to go through the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure.\\nCorrection:\\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly described the period of time that City Planning has gone without reviewing applications for office buildings, based on information from the agency.\\nWhat we’re thinking about\\n: What City Council races are you watching closely?

Residents of City Island have complained over the years about the noise from the shooting range. NYPD representatives say the new facility will result in “almost zero to no noise at all.”\\nClosing Time\\nResidential:\\nThe priciest residential sale Monday was\\n$33.9 million\\nfor a condo unit at 15 Central Park West. The Zeckendorf-developed unit’s last on-market sale was $22.7 million in 2008, though the condo is selling less than its initial listing price of over $60 million.\\nCommercial:\\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\\n$150 million\\nfor 333 West 34th Street.

That’s a significant retrenchment from the\\n391-unit project proposed\\ntwo years ago.\\nMichael Dubb’s firm capsized the unit count amid concerns from the community, which Dubb said was a voluntary decision. The $220 million project now comprises 53 single-family homes, 153 townhomes and 82 villas, 29 of which would be set aside for affordable housing.\\nThe development is still set to unfold on a property at the corner of Old Northport and Lawrence roads, previously home to a concrete manufacturing and sand mining operation. It also complies with Smithtown’s Comprehensive Plan.\\nBut opposition remains. The president of the Kings Park Community Association says the group remains concerned the development is too large and that the reduction in size will simply open the door for other developers to increase the size of their own adjacent projects. He added the project “provides no discernible benefits to the community.” Concerns also include the area’s environment, drinking water, traffic and schools.\\n\\nBeechwood is building a wastewater sewage treatment plant in conjunction with the Country Pointe Estates. The development is still a long way off; Dubb is hoping to secure all approvals by 2027 and complete work on the development by 2030.\\nKings Park is home to several sizable projects, creating concerns for some community members about overdevelopment. Smithtown is creating a comprehensive master plan for Kings Park’s downtown development.\\nDespite concerns about overdevelopment, there’s also a need to update the housing stock in the hamlet; the Country Pointe Estates project could increase the number of units in the hamlet by 4.4 percent alone, according to project consultants.\\n—\\nHolden Walter-Warner\\n',\n",

The deal was signed at the start of the year and closed a week ago.\\nThe buyer used a limited liability company of its own to obscure its identity, but the entity appears to share an address with another well-known landlord, Taconic Partners, which also owns the neighboring property to the west of the asset. A representative for Taconic, however, denied the firm’s involvement to\\nThe Real Deal\\n.\\nA representative for Brookfield also did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\\nThe Real Deal\\n.\\nThe sale of the 287,000-square-foot office property works out to $523 per square foot. That’s a small gain on the price per buildable square foot Brookfield paid New York REIT for the property in 2018, but not on the price per built square foot: Brookfield sold the property for more than $100 million less than\\nthe $255 million\\nit paid for the property seven years ago.\\nTenants at the 10-story building include the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Sam Ash Music and Godiva Chocolatier. The MTA leases at least 100,000 square feet, according to\\nCompStak\\n, and is on a lease that isn’t set to expire until 2035.\\n\\nIt’s unclear who brokered the transaction for either side.\\nThe Garment District has been trimming the spirits of office landlords lately. A couple of weeks ago, Bahrain-based Investcorp took a hit on a pair of buildings in the neighborhood, selling them to Josh Rahmani’s Empire Capital Holdings\\nfor at least 68 percent below\\nwhat it paid for them less than a decade ago.\\nBrookfield’s office luck has been a mixed bag of late, landing big leases but also facing serious distress. This month, the investor positioned itself to\\nbuy a $93 million delinquent loan\\non a distressed office building in San Francisco, which would allow the firm to ultimately take control of Vanbarton Group’s 22-story property.\\n—\\nHolden Walter-Warner\\n',\n",

The lease spans the entire corner site at East 60th Street.\\nAt one time, a Citibank branch occupied a portion of the ground-floor corner space of the property, which is also home to the Parc Cinq luxury building. In 2023, the building’s co-op board — which controls the retail space — retained Newmark to market the site on Fifth Avenue’s famed retail corridor.\\nThe asking rent for the two-floor space was $4.8 million per year. The duration of the lease was not disclosed.\\nA Newmark team including Jeffrey Roseman, Caleb Petersen and Drew Weiss represented the co-op board. CBRE’s Jonathan Schley and GoodSpace’s Chris DeCrosta represented the tenant.\\n\\nThe retail space used to have narrow windows befitting a bank, which have since been expanded. The alterations needed to go through the Landmarks Preservation Commission because the property is in a historic district.\\nThis will be the global watchmaker’s third spot in Manhattan. The Swiss company also has a sales boutique at 66 East 57th Street and a service center at 52-58 Gansevoort Street.\\nIt’s upping the ante with space on Fifth Avenue, long considered international shopping destination. It’s set to undergo a seismic change after the city reached a deal with the merchants to redesign the street, Gothamist\\nreported\\nin the fall, which will see more space opened for pedestrians by doubling the width of the sidewalks between Bryant Park and Central Park.\\nCity officials have estimated the redesign would cost $350 million, excluding the price of relocating underground utilities and sewers.\\n—\\nHolden Walter-Warner\\n',\n",

Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance subsidiary Barings purchased the property at auction on Thursday for $161 million.\\nAt least three prospective bidders appeared interested in the property prior to the auction, according to court records. Barings, however, was the only qualified bidder to actually attend the event last week.\\nIn May, MassMutual\\nfiled a complaint\\nagainst Rechler’s firm after it defaulted on a $315 million mortgage, which matured earlier in the year. A spokesperson for the company said at the time that the property was high quality, but had a “broken capital structure.” RXR had identified the building as “digital” as opposed to “film,” meaning it was part of the company’s portfolio that was deemed worth keeping.\\nA loan modification was still a possibility at the time. As of May, there were about 300,000 square feet available, representing 40 percent of the building’s total rentable area.\\n\\nRXR in April leased about 7,000 square feet to investment firm Yaupon Capital Management and 5,500 to Northampton Capital Partners, an infrastructure and energy-transition investment firm led by a former Apollo Global Management executive. RXR also signed renewals with SRS Real Estate Partners and Edelman Financial Engines and new leases with investment firm Tide Rock and Boundary Creek Advisors.\\nThe 22-story, 760,000-square-foot building has estimated asking rents between $68 and $83 per square foot, according to CoStar.\\nAn RXR representative declined to comment to Crain’s on the auction.\\nIn better news for Rechler, RXR and SL Green\\nworked out a deal\\non the $940 million mortgage backed by Worldwide Plaza on Eighth Avenue. The borrowers, which also include a subsidiary of the liquidating company for New York REIT, will use loan reserves to fund operating expenses and debt service shortfalls, according to Morningstar; the loan is still set to come due in November 2027.\\n—\\nHolden Walter-Warner\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'As the many candidates for mayor call for huge numbers of new homes — from\\n200,000\\n(Zohran Mamdani) to\\n500,000\\n(Brad Lander) to\\n700,000\\n(Zellnor Myrie) — Kenny Burgos is calling them out.\\nThe CEO of the New York Apartment Association claims that most candidates are not truly pushing “abundance” as a housing goal, because none has identified a target vacancy rate.\\nAbundance in housing means having far more units than is needed — that is, high vacancy — so renters and buyers negotiate prices down instead of bidding them up.\\n“A 5 to 10 percent vacancy rate should be the goal for a healthy housing market,” Burgos said on his\\nlatest podcast\\n, reflecting the consensus view of economists.\\nBut few city politicians take that position, for one simple reason: A vacancy rate of 5 percent would legally end the city’s “\\nhousing emergency\\n” and thus rent stabilization.\\n“Over the past 50 years, elected officials have attempted to keep the housing stock as close to a 4 percent vacancy rate as possible,” Burgos said.\\nIt’s a classic case of the tail wagging the dog.\\nBefore\\nThe Real Deal\\n’s publisher, Amir Korangy, chides me for using an esoteric expression that confuses readers, I will explain. “\\nThe tail wagging the dog\\n” means something important or powerful is being controlled by something that isn’t.\\n\\nIn this case, housing policy should determine the vacancy rate, not the other way around. But that isn’t what happens in New York.\\nBeginning with the citywide rezoning of 1961, elected officials have limited development, which along with strong demand to live in the city has kept the vacancy rate below the all-important 5 percent mark. When the rate surged after Covid, politicians\\ndelayed\\nthe Housing and Vacancy Survey until it went back down.\\nThen it kept falling, all the way to a 56-year low of\\n1.4 percent\\n. That was a\\nturning point\\nin New York City politics. It’s the reason all the candidates are talking about\\nadding supply\\n.\\nBut, as Burgos alluded to, they don’t want to add enough to solve the problem, because rent-stabilization would disappear and about 2 million tenants would storm City Hall like the January 6 mob did on Capitol Hill.\\nBurgos represents owners of rent-stabilized housing, who obviously would rejoice at being able to charge market-rate rent. That doesn’t mean he’s wrong about\\nrent control\\nbeing a\\nfailed policy\\n.\\nOn his podcast, the lobby group CEO challenged reporters to demand mayoral candidates reveal their desired vacancy rate. Tempting as that might be for journalists, it would serve no purpose because no Democrat could advocate for ending rent stabilization and expect to win the primary.\\nBetter to cheer the plans that have a chance to break the 5 percent threshold, such as\\nMyrie’s\\nand\\nLander’s\\n, even if the candidates will never admit that is possible.\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'The Agency’s Mike Fabbri was almost across the finish line on a Downtown Manhattan co-op sale.\\nHis buyer, a woman in her 30s, had already signed a contract for the apartment and agreed to pay in cash. All that was left was the board application, a historically arduous process, but he was confident she fit the bill.\\nThen came deal-breaking news — his buyer was the proud owner of a cockatoo.\\nFabbri scrambled to pull together documentation that might convince the board that a new winged resident wasn’t such a bad idea. He collected letters of recommendation from his buyer’s previous landlord and a friend who used to watch her bird on occasion. Her doctor wrote a note testifying to the bird’s capabilities as an emotional support animal.\\nThe co-op board rejected her bid. Boards don’t typically give a reason for their refusal, but given her other qualifications, Fabbri suspects it was the cockatoo.\\nIn my time as a reporter, brokers across the city have recounted similar tales, especially when selling Manhattan co-ops, where rules are stringent and even the slightest error on a board package — or a dog teetering on the edge of 50 pounds — can scrap a deal.\\nAs prices for co-ops stagnated, and buyers turned increasingly to condos, agents say several boards have\\nrelaxed many of their policies\\n, allowing buyers to finance more of their purchase or renovate their apartments in months that aren’t June, July or August.\\nCould requirements for pets, which appraiser Jonathan Miller\\nonce referred to\\nas a “dog weighing-in ceremony,” be the next to ease? While most still have weight and breed restrictions, blanket bans on pets are likely near impossible, since the pandemic prompted many New Yorkers to adopt a furry family member.\\n“People are not giving up their dogs, even if they love the apartment,” said Brown Harris Stevens’ Lisa Simonsen. “Some people would probably prefer to leave behind a teenager.”\\nEven with restrictions still in place, brokers have found ways to skirt around the rules — and it usually involves tacking on a few numbers to the purchase price.\\nOne of Simonsen’s buyers was approved to buy a Park Avenue co-op, despite her two 70- to 80-pound hunting dogs.\\n“When you get to the point that you’re getting full ask or over ask, they don’t say no so quickly.”\\nUnlike Fabbri, other brokers have gotten lucky with the paperwork. About eight years ago, Compass’ Vickey Barron was representing a doctor in the purchase of a co-op on lower Fifth Avenue.\\n\\nDuring the board interview, a member asked him if anyone would be staying in his apartment, to which he replied, his girlfriend, and potentially her dog. His response sent Barron on a chase to assemble the dog’s vaccination records, adoption papers and anything else she could think of to prove the dog wouldn’t be a problem.\\nThe board’s final request was for her buyer to bring the dog in for an interview.\\nThe pup must have passed the test because Barron’s buyer got the apartment. But last she checked, he’d lost the girlfriend. And her dog.\\nNot so fast…\\nThe time for acquisitions is now — at least that’s what Real Trends co-founder Steve Murray\\nprophesied on a panel\\nat the HousingWire conference almost a year ago. And the latest headlines are proving him right.\\nRumors swirled on Thursday that Compass was closing in on a deal to buy Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices. The speculation was all but confirmed in the afternoon when the Wall Street Journal reported that the firms were in\\n“advanced talks,”\\nthough the story lacked any specifics about the pending sale.\\nHomeServices CEO Gino Blefari\\nrefuted the reporting\\nin an email sent around to franchisees, claiming “no such sale is being contemplated.”\\nTales of the alleged acquisition came just months after Compass purchased @properties and Christie’s International Real Estate,\\na $444 million sale\\nthat sent shockwaves across the industry. In New York City, Compass and the local BHHS affiliate were both among the\\ntop brokerages\\nby sales volume in 2023, with Compass holding the No.2 spot with $5 billion in sell-side deals and BHHS in 18th with just under $100 million.\\nIn the first two weeks of March, other major national brokerages have announced deals of their own. Keller Williams Realty, the largest brokerage by agent count, sold\\na significant stake\\nto Stone Point Capital, the parent company of CoreLogic. Earlier this week, mortgage firm Rocket Companies\\npaid $1.75 billion\\nto acquire Redfin.\\nWith two deals in the books before the end of the first quarter, signs are pointing toward more acquisitions in the year to come — even if Compass buying BHHS isn’t one of them.\\nNYC Deal of the Week\\nActress Grace Hightower sold the Central Park West co-op she shared with her ex-husband, Robert De Niro, for\\n$18 million\\nin the priciest deal to close in the city this week. The couple bought the apartment at 88 Central Park West for $21 million almost two decades ago.\\nThe home, which De Niro and Hightower renovated after a fire in 2012, has five bedrooms, views of Central Park and an eat-in kitchen.\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'Waiting for a new Penn Station is a little like waiting for a train at Penn Station.\\nYou are standing in the NJ Transit train hall, neck craned back slightly to stare down a screen that promises your train is “on time.” A small number will appear next to your train, telling you where to catapult your body to join a swarm of commuters competing to squeeze onto the tiny escalator that will deliver you to your train.\\nBut the number never appears, despite an automated voice that tells you the train is pulling up to the station. You get an alert on your phone that says all trains are suspended in and out of Penn because someone sneezed near some Amtrak signal cables. Or NJ Transit needs to investigate the sneeze; it is unclear. You know that no trains are coming, but that automated, female voice keeps informing you, over and over, that phantom trains are pulling up to the station.\\nThat disembodied voice is a little like the announcements that the state is kick-starting a plan to redevelop Penn Station. You hear it, you want to believe it and then you wait and nothing happens.\\nI’ve been covering this project for the past 10 years, and in that time, the state has reintroduced the project at least five times. Many visions, by both the state and outside groups, have been pitched during that time.\\nThis week Grand Penn Alliance, a group backed by hedge fund manager and Republican donor Thomas Klingenstein,\\naccording to Gothamist\\n, reupped a proposal it introduced in 2023. The plan calls for moving Madison Square Garden to the former Hotel Penn site, and building a park on the former arena site. Renderings show a classical facade, new train hall and single-level concourse. Last week Assembly member Tony Simone\\npitched\\nrevising plans for a megadevelopment surrounding the station to include more housing and a park on the Hotel Penn site.\\nWe’re still waiting on the state to announce its next move on redesigning Penn Station and whether Gov. Kathy Hochul’s meeting with President Donald Trump on Friday will help get things moving. We’ve been on standby for decades, and this train will not pull into the station until funding is lined up for the project.\\nWhat we’re thinking about\\n: What is going on with\\nBerkshire Hathaway HomeServices and Compass\\n? Send a note to\\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\\n.\\nA thing we’ve learned\\n: Mets owner Steve Cohen’s casino project, which his press people will no doubt remind us should be referred to as Metropolitan Park, this week\\ngot the rezoning\\nit needs from the City Council, Gothamist reports. That was not a surprise, because the local Council member, Francisco Moya, supports the plan.\\nCohen’s main obstacle is getting parkland alienation from the state legislature, because the local state senator, Sen. Jessica Ramos, doesn’t want a casino in her district.\\n\\nIt’s possible that the legislature will alienate the parkland over her objections, but that is rare for Albany. If ever an exception would be made, it would be for something like this. The parkland is really just a parking lot. —\\nErik Engquist\\nElsewhere in New York…\\n— President Donald Trump hinted Thursday that he may seek Gov. Kathy Hochul’s approval of a controversial pipeline as part of discussions that include congestion pricing and the redevelopment of Penn Station,\\nGothamist reports\\n. The so-called Constitution Pipeline would stretch 124 miles through New York’s Southern Tier and western Catskills.\\n— City health officials say two pet cats died after being infected with bird flu,\\nthe New York Times reports\\n. The cause of the infections was not clear, though potential sources include unpasteurized milk, contact with infected birds and infected food.\\n— Last month Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado announced that he will not seek re-election next year. Now, it seems he’s preparing to run for something else.\\nCity &amp; State reports\\nthat Delgado spoke at New York Somos in Albany last weekend and delivered “stump speech-sounding remarks.” He did not attend Hochul’s private reception at the Executive Mansion.\\nClosing Time\\nResidential:\\nThe priciest residential sale Friday was\\n$15.6 million\\nfor a condo unit at 535 West End Avenue. The Upper West Side condo is 6,600 square feet. The unit was last sold in 2013 for $16.3 million.\\nCommercial:\\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\\n$161.3 million\\nfor 334-342 Madison Avenue. The 22-story office building was sold at auction after RXR’s Scott Rechler defaulted on a\\n$315 million\\nmortgage on the building.\\nNew to the Market:\\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $7.2 million for 160 Leroy Street. The West Village condo is 2,000 square feet.\\nDouglas Elliman’s\\nArlene Gutterson has the listing.\\nBreaking Ground:\\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 66,886-square-foot, 12-story residential building at 10 Van Cortlandt Avenue East in the Bronx.

       "  'content': 'For some New York City property owners, there’s still not enough incentive to limit carbon emissions.\\nDozens of landlords are planning to pay fines for failing to comply with Local Law 97, rather than retrofit their properties to reduce emissions, according to responses by more than two dozen building sector executives to the Center for an Urban Future\\nreported\\nby Crain’s.\\nSome owners think the bottom line looks better if they absorb the fines that will be levied against them for failing to meet decarbonization goals dictated by the law. Retrofitting properties’ lighting, insulation and various systems can be a costly endeavor in itself.\\n“It’s a tough sell,” Center for an Urban Future policy director Eli Dvorkin told Crain’s. “For many building owners, it just comes down to pretty basic math, and right now the payback period for those investments is long and getting longer with higher interest rates and rising costs for borrowing.”\\nBuilding owners are set to pay $268 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions that exceeds a property’s 2024 limit, varying by building. Owners are required to file reports with the city by Mary to demonstrate compliance; emission reduction targets are set to grow at the end of the decade.\\nSo far, a vast majority of buildings required to meet emissions targets are in compliance with the law. The Department of Buildings claims fewer than 11 percent are out of compliance with 2024-26 emissions targets.\\n\\nTo ensure future compliance, however, Dvorkin suggested the city may need to\\nimpose higher fees\\nfor violating the decarbonization law, something the Real Estate Board of New York opposes.\\nAnother possibility is for the city to increase incentives and financial assistance to help property owners comply with the law, such as providing additional funds and tax credits.\\n“The green economy isn’t just going to build itself,” Dvorkin added.\\nThe aim of Local Law 97 is for the city to cut emissions 40 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050 from 2005 levels.\\n—\\nHolden Walter-Warner\\n',\n",

It marks the first South Florida development for New York-based Trinity, an owner-builder that has been involved in the ownership, assemblage or construction of more than 1 million square feet in its history, according to a press release.\\nJMH launched sales of an 11-unit building on the site about\\ntwo years ago\\n.\\nTrinity bought into the project for an undisclosed amount in September, Lozito said, declining to disclose more details about the deal.\\n“We took the hard work that JMH has done and put our own spin on it,” he said.\\nThe development, which will overlook the Indian Creek waterway, will now include a 20-unit condo building with one- and two-bedroom units, and two two-story townhouses, the release said. Prices will range from $1.4 million to just over $3 million, and the developers tapped Ryan Serhant’s\\neponymous firm\\nto lead sales. Serhant’s other South Florida projects include Mercedes-Benz Places and MG Developer’s\\nThe George\\ntownhouse development in Coral Gables.\\nThe 29 Indian Creek condos will range from 820 square feet to 1,750 square feet. The townhouses will include 500-square-foot terraces with summer kitchens and wet bars.\\n\\nThe project will have “as many [amenities] as the big developments,” including a rooftop pool, gym and fitness area,” Lozito said. Urban Robot is designing the development.\\nBuyers will also receive membership to the beach club at the nearby Miami Beach Edition, according to the release.\\nThe team could begin demolition work in April and begin construction shortly after that. The project could be completed by the end of 2026. Trinity is bringing its team down and will supplement construction labor with local subcontractors.\\nThe developers will self-fund construction at the start and later take out a construction loan, Lozito said. Trinity is looking to work on additional projects in South Florida, he added.\\nThe 0.3-acre Indian Creek development site previously traded in 2017 for $7.8 million. Halpern’s JMH was tied up in\\nlitigation\\nwith former partners who included investor Dhruv Piplani.

In December, a foreclosure complaint was filed against Masoud and Stephanie Shojaee and two trusts under his name for allegedly failing to repay a\\n$10.5 million\\nloan secured by the retail component of Shoma Village. The lender voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit two weeks after filing it.\\nIn January,\\nCity National Bank\\nfiled a foreclosure lawsuit against Masoud Shojaee and a Shoma entity alleging default on loans totaling $14.1 million, including a mortgage on a Coral Gables condo where the Shojaees reside.

Wu also managed an entity that owned a former federal immigration building at 7880 Biscayne Boulevard in Miami.\\nThe trailer park site and the immigration building landed in court receivership as a result of a 2020 Miami-Dade civil lawsuit alleging Wu’s entities misappropriated funds from\\nEB-5 visa investors\\n. The federal program grants permanent residency to foreign investors who finance business and real estate development projects in the U.S., as well as their immediate family members.\\nIn 2023, receiver Michael Goldberg entered into a settlement agreement with Wu that allowed the sale of the properties to move forward without Wu’s objections. Upon both deals closing, Wu will receive $5 million from the sale proceeds.

While aging suburban buildings have traded at discounts and\\nforeclosures\\nhave popped up, Broward County recently scored two office deals for over $200 million each.\\nAn entity managed by Jorge Linkewer, principal at Aventura-based Triarch Capital Group, as well as Sarah and Sergio Selcer bought the complex at 4101 Ravenswood Road in Dania Beach from ACP Partners, according to records and real estate database Vizzda.\\nSergio Selcer is associated with Step by Step Management in Coconut Creek. ACP is managed by Mario Henriquez and affiliated with Brickell-based JCT Management, according to Vizzda and state corporate records.\\nThe buyers borrowed $10.3 million from Popular Bank.\\nCompleted in 1987, Airport Commerce Park consists of four one-story buildings on a 6.6-acre site, property records show. ACP Partners paid $13.3 million for the property in 2007.\\nTenants include computer repair service Rescuecom of Fort Lauderdale, Ocean Exotic Car Rental, Precision Air Conditioning, Digital Marketing Service Pro and the Consulate of Sweden.\\n\\nTriarch, founded in 1996 by Linkewer, Daniel Halberstein and Mario Grosfeld, has a portfolio of about 3.5 million square feet of commercial real estate, according to its website. Linkewer also is founder of brokerage Axiom Capital Advisors, which lists the same Aventura office as Triarch.\\nTriarch is a frequent South Florida investor. In 2023, it bought the Shoppes at 41st Street plaza at 10355 and 10405 Northwest 41st Street in Doral for\\n$18 million\\n. That came on the heels of Triarch’s\\n$7.2 million\\npurchase of an industrial outdoor storage site at 12601 West Okeechobee Road in Hialeah Gardens.\\nIn 2020, the firm scored a\\n$35 million\\nrefinancing for the One Turnberry Place office building at 19495 Biscayne Boulevard in Aventura, which Triarch bought in 2011 for $53 million.\\nIn the fourth quarter, South Florida\\noffice\\nvacancies and asking rents\\nremained flat or slightly increased\\n, year-over-year, according to an Avison Young report. Broward County’s average asking rent hit $40.18 per square foot, up from $38.34 a square foot during the same period of 2023. The vacancy rate fell to 14.5 percent from 16.8 percent. But in all of last year,\\nBroward’s\\ntotal leasing was 2.4 million square feet, a 27 percent decline from 2023, the Avison report shows.\\nGenerally, real estate has felt the sting from higher interest rates, skyrocketing insurance and a slowdown of the influx of out-of-state companies, experts have said.\\nSome properties have traded at a discount. In September, Galium Capital bought the Lake Shore Plaza II office building at 1300 Concord Terrace in Sunrise for\\n$17 million\\n, a nearly 47 percent discount from its price in 2013. In January, Accesso Partners bought the six-story Sawgrass Lake Center at 13450 West Sunrise Boulevard in Sunrise for\\n$36.5 million\\n, a 36.4 percent discount from its price in 2018.\\nStill, downtown Fort Lauderdale scored two mammoth deals. Last month, DWS Group sold the\\xa0 Las Olas Centre I &amp; II at 350 and 450 East Las Olas Boulevard for\\n$208 million\\n, and the\\xa0 Bank of America Plaza at Las Olas City Centre at 401 East Las Olas Boulevard for\\n$220 million\\n.\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'A partially built luxury condo project in North Bay Village, the city’s first in more than a decade, may be back on track.\\nNever one to shy away from a challenge, Vivian Dimond\\nstepped in\\nto take over development and construction of what is now called Tula Residences, a 54-unit, 21-story (once it’s finished) building on the waterfront.\\nConstruction workers disappeared from the site in late 2023.\\nDimond’s Bayshore Grove Capital took over the LLC that owns the property last year. Malaysian developer Pacific &amp; Orient, led by CEO Thye Seng Chan, will remain a partner in the project.\\nIn Miami, most condo developers use the following strategy: buy land, hire a public relations firm to tease a project launch, begin sales, open a sales center, publicize that opening — maybe with a splashy party — etc.\\nChan didn’t really follow that approach. His firm waited to launch sales of the project, didn’t make much of a splash when he did, and self-funded construction. The unit layouts weren’t ideal, brokers and developers told me.\\nLiens began to pile up, including nearly $7 million sought by the former general contractor. One vendor sued. That’s when everything went dark. Residents on the island were not happy.\\nI don’t know exactly when Dimond’s Bayshore Grove finalized its deal, but it made sense when I learned that she would be reviving the project. She made changes to the layout and floor plans, moved the lobby from the sixth floor (unusual choice by the original developer) to the ground floor, and plans to install larger windows for better views.\\nOnce the building is completed in 2026, it will mark eight years since Pacific &amp; Orient secured its approvals.\\nDimond’s sales team, led by Brown Harris Stevens’ Ellis Bachman, is tasked with selling nearly all of the units. Pacific &amp; Orient only had two buyers with contracts at the North Bay Village project. One was refunded, and another is staying in the deal, Dimond told me.\\nWhile many developers seemed to shy away from the project, she saw it as an opportunity to be the first one out of the gate.\\nNorth Bay Village has attracted tens of millions of dollars of investment, if not more, in recent years. But no one has gotten this far. Even though others (Eichner, Shoma, Sunbeam, Riviera Horizons, etc.) have launched sales of their projects, garnering much more attention than what is now called Tula ever did, Dimond’s project is the furthest along, construction-wise.\\nWhile there are downsides to picking up a project midway through construction, the upsides may outweigh them.\\n\\nIt will become harder and more expensive to complete a building from scratch today, given the situation with tariffs, concerns over construction labor as a result of immigration policies, inflation and more.\\nBuyers are also less enthusiastic about waiting four, five, six years for a project to be completed. This is at a time when dozens of new condo developments are in the pipeline. Despite developer and broker talk of strong presales, we’re hearing that a small number of projects are stalled.\\nWhat we’re thinking about:\\nSo many Live Local Act project applications have been filed in South Florida. Are these developments getting built? Send me a note at\\nkk@therealdeal.com\\n.\\nCLOSING TIME\\nResidential:\\nDeveloper James Curnin and his wife Jennifer sold their waterfront 9,640-square-foot home at 66 La Gorce Circle in Miami Beach\\nfor $60 million\\n. A land trust named after the address purchased the property.\\nCommercial loan:\\nPPG Development and BH3 Management secured a\\n$225 million refinancing\\nof the loan backing Slate Hallandale Beach, a 250-unit apartment tower next to the Shell Bay Club. J.P. Morgan and Monroe Capital provided the latest financing for the building, which was completed in 2022. The lenders have both worked closely with Witkoff, which is partnering with PPG on the adjacent Shell Bay project.\\nNEW TO THE MARKET\\nA new oceanfront estate in Palm Beach hit the market\\nfor $45 million\\n. The six-bedroom, seven-bathroom and one-half-bath mansion at 1742 South Ocean Boulevard was completed last year on a 0.6-acre lot. Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate has the listing for the 8,170-square-foot house. Property records show a company managed by recycling mogul Anthony Lomangino paid $10 million for the lot in 2020 — a steal in Palm Beach.\\nA thing we’ve learned\\nThe Great Elephant Migration, an art installation of 100 life-size elephant sculptures, is actually\\nstill in South Florida\\n. You may remember it as one of the most photographed Art Basel exhibits last year. Three elephants are on display at Four Seasons Hotel and Residences Fort Lauderdale, available to the public, while another four are at Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach. They’ll be there until Tuesday.\\nElsewhere in Florida\\nSwerdlow Group agreed to implement a voluntary heat safety program for construction workers at its $3 billion project in Little River and Little Haiti,\\nPrism\\nreports. The Miami-Dade Housing Committee recently reviewed the development agreement for the 63-acre mixed-use development. Swerdlow is the first to make such a voluntary move after state lawmakers passed House Bill 433, which bans local governments from mandating heat protections.\\nDevelopers are increasingly building homes on former orange groves, marking another threat to Florida’s orange industry, according to the\\nAssociated Press\\n. Consumers are also drinking less orange juice, and citrus greening disease has hit the industry hard in recent decades.\\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers grilled state insurance regulators about a report that showed insurers funneled billions of dollars to affiliates between 2017 and 2019 while they claimed to lose money. The regulators told lawmakers that the report was never given to the legislature because it was unfinished, the\\nTampa Bay Times\\nreports. Former Insurance Commissioner David Altmaier commissioned the report, but after he abruptly left his post to become a lobbyist, it was left in draft form.',\n",

The founder of SBE knows how to make hotspots buzzy for a work-hard, play-hard crowd of A-listers.\\nBy 2019, Nazarian had nine offices around the world and 11,000 employees. “I was the majority owner of my company, and I was the most unhealthy I’d ever been,” he said. “I didn’t have the same ambition and drive that I’d had.”\\nThat year, he\\nsold the hotel brands in a cash-and-asset swap to Accor\\n.\\n“I was looking for a reset,” he said. The deal included a three-year non-compete clause in the lifestyle sector, giving him time to contemplate his next “disruption.”\\nNazarian turned to friends who were feeling the same burn-out. They turned him on to health types like\\nMark Hyman\\nand “biohacker” Gary Brecka. From there, his wellness journey took him to luxury longevity retreats like SHA and Lanserhof and Chenot.\\nThen along came Tony Robbins.\\nRobbins was early to some of wellness’s more unconventional practices: “Tony was the first guy who was going in an ice bath, and everyone thought he was crazy,” as Nazarian put it. Nazarian visited Robbins’ Fountain Life longevity center in Orlando, Florida. There, a bevy of tests found a “pretty aggressive” aneurysm in his brain.\\n“Over the next 30 days, I saw four top neurosurgeons, got four opinions, did more testing and then had a seven hour brain surgery that removed the aneurysm,” he told\\nThe Real Deal.\\nThe aneurysm is gone, but Nazarian’s commitment to preventative health and his relationship with Robbins continue.\\nNazarian and Robbins are working\\ntogether on wellness-focused hotels\\nand longevity centers with a new brand called the Estate. (They’ve already\\ninked a lease\\nfor a center at the Reuben Brothers’ Century Plaza, have a hotel under development in St. Kitts, and plan 25 locations by 2030.) Meanwhile, Nazarian and entertainer Marc Anthony, who’s also a partner on the Estate, launched a new hotel brand. HQ, which is a partnership with Wyndham, will also have a wellness and longevity strategy.\\nNazarian’s next\\nbusiness boom\\nmay not have the same hard-partying style as the last one, and his weekends reflect that. With a wife, three kids and a home in Miami’s Gables Estates neighborhood, weekends are more about kids’ basketball games and family dinners than the nightlife scene or even business meetings.\\nFriday\\nEvening\\nShabbat dinner with my wife and three kids. We do it every Friday night. We’re not very religious, but my kids are eight, six and three so it’s something we’ve always had as part of our cultural component.\\nMy mom flew in from L.A., so having her with us was a treat as well. I grew up in Los Angeles but we’ve lived in Miami for five years now. This is our biggest market area, and we made a conscious effort in 2019 to raise our kids in Miami as well, so we got a place in Coral Gables, where the best schools are.\\n\\nWe also have access to more quality-of-life things here, like being out on the water. We have a place in the Bahamas as well. And obviously proximity to Europe, which is very important to us; my wife’s European, so we have a home in Montenegro. It’s just easier to get around the world from Miami.\\nSaturday\\nMorning\\nI took my three-year-old son to soccer practice, then I took my daughters to tennis practice at Coral Oaks.\\nAfternoon\\nAt 12 p.m., I had lunch on my yacht with one of our bankers from CFG, Erik Howard. Actually, on the way there I went and saw a site, but we haven’t announced that yet.\\nThe rest of the day, we took the boat out to Fisher Island Bay as a family. In L.A., you’re on the water, but you never go out in the water. Now we have a boat in the back of our house, a 48-foot bay boat, but we also ended up buying the yacht in 2021. That’s a 42-meter Benetti. Nothing crazy, but big enough for us and a couple friends.\\nUsually we keep it in the Caribbean, at our place in the Bahamas or we’ll go to St. Barths or discover new islands. But it just so happened to be here, so we jumped on it. It’s such a pleasure to have it and get to see the city from the water.\\nSunday\\nMorning\\nI worked out in the morning. We have these oxygen and red light machines in our house, so I got in the hyperbaric chamber and red light in addition to the workout. Then I took the girls to Hebrew school.\\nAfternoon\\nI went to a meeting with our general contractor. We’re actually building a permanent bio-hacking and longevity addition [on our house]. Our team from the Estates designed it. When you think about home gyms and spas, they’ve been very traditional. We really believe that there are some key components – saunas, the red light and oxygen — that can pivotally change the different KPIs you’re looking for, whether it’s better sleep, deeper sleep … there are lots of benefits.\\nRight now I have the machinery, and now we’re integrating it into a new structure. Another part of it is a meditation room, kind of a quiet room. We have three young kids, they can’t find you there.\\nAfter that I took my son to the park before I coached my daughters’ basketball game from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Then I had meetings from 4 p.m to 7 p.m on Sunday, because we had a board meeting on Monday.\\nWant to hear more about Sam Nazarian’s next chapter? TRD subscribers can join him at the next Salon Series event on April 3 to learn more.\\nRSVP today\\n.',\n",

       "  'content': 'The First Amendment may not save O Cinema from getting evicted for screening an Oscar winning documentary about the Gaza War and events that led to it.\\nOn Wednesday, the\\nMiami Beach\\nCity Commission will consider Mayor Steven Meiner’s request to terminate O Cinema’s lease for a movie theater space inside a city-owned historic building at 1130 Washington Avenue, as well as end roughly $40,000 in grants to the nonprofit arthouse.\\nMeiner moved to kick out O Cinema after it went ahead with sold-out showings of “No Other Land,” a film about the ongoing conflict between Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank. Directed by Palestinian activist Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham, “No Other Land” won best documentary feature at this year’s Academy Awards.\\nIn a newsletter to his constituents, Meiner called the film “a false one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our City and residents.”\\nMeiner and city officials did not respond to requests for comment. O Cinema co-founder Kareem Tabsch told\\nThe Real Deal\\nthat the nonprofit art house is ready to pursue “all courses to allow us to continue operating in Miami Beach.”\\n“We haven’t ruled out what those measures would be,” Tabsch said. “I think it is very clear that when we decided to continue showing this film, [Meiner] introduced a resolution to pull our funding and cancel the lease.”\\nO Cinema is getting legal counsel from the Florida chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and Community Justice Project, “ Tabsch added.\\nWhile some civil libertarians believe Miami Beach officials would be violating O Cinema’s right to free speech by evicting the theater, the lease terms favor the city, according to commercial real estate experts.\\n\\nA copy of the agreement obtained by\\nThe Real Deal\\nshows that the city can terminate the lease “without cause and without liability to the landlord” as long as O Cinema is given 180 days prior written notice. O Cinema’s five-year lease expired last year, but in April the city commission approved the tenant’s option to renew for another two years, city records show.\\n“To the extent it can be shown that canceling the lease was based [on the content of “No Other Land,”] there would be a First Amendment violation claim,” said Miami-based attorney Mitchell Jagodinski. “The question for the court would be whether the operator of the theater waived this claim via the lease contract.”\\nJagodinski is representing the developers of\\nMiami Wilds\\n, a canceled mixed-use project in unincorporated southwest Miami-Dade County that planned to feature a water park, 200-room hotel and 20,000 square feet of restaurants. Last year, Miami-Dade sued Mami Wilds to terminate a 2022 lease agreement to build the project on 66 acres of county-owned land.\\nMiami Wilds\\ncountersued by alleging Miami-Dade Mayor Danielle Levine Cava violated the developers’ rights by allegedly killing the deal to appease environmental groups and boost her reelection chances.\\nO Cinema likely waived a First Amendment claim by agreeing to the city’s “termination for convenience” clause, Jagodinski said. “It essentially gives the city full control to just cancel [the lease] whenever they want for whatever reason,” he explained. “[O Cinema] agreed to this type of situation eventually happening.”\\nMiami Beach\\nelected officials are definitely within their purview to end the business relationship with O Cinema, said Jose Smith, a former city attorney for Miami Beach and North Miami Beach who also served on the Miami Beach City Commission from 1997 to 2005.\\n“I have not seen the entire documentary or the city’s lease with O Cinema,” Smith said via text. “However, the First Amendment does not require the city to permit its tenant, in a city owned venue, to espouse anti-Semitic, hateful, one-sided propaganda, or to be subsidized by the city for doing so.”\\nYet, Norman Powell, a North Bay Village-based real estate lawyer who is also the city attorney for\\nMiramar\\n, isn’t convinced the city of Miami Beach’s “termination for convenience” clause would trump a potential First Amendment violation claim by O Cinema.\\n“It’s clear that the mayor’s primary reason for terminating the lease is because he doesn’t like this documentary being played there,” Powell said. “The basis for termination is really not for convenience. It’s being terminated to stifle free speech.”',\n",

       "  'content': 'Affordable housing developer Lewis Swezy plans an 80-unit age-restricted apartment project near the Earlington Heights Metrorail stop in Miami-Dade County.\\nSwezy, through his Miami Lakes-based Centennial Management, wants to develop the six-story building with 60 one-bedroom apartments and 20 two-bedroom apartments on a 0.7-acre site at 4052 Northwest 22nd Avenue in an unincorporated area of the county, according to an application submitted to Miami-Dade this week. It will include rooftop amenities, 800 square feet of commercial space and 42 parking spaces.\\nThe project, called Earlington Court Affordable Housing, will be for tenants 55 and older who earn from 30 percent to 80 percent of the area median income, Swezy said. A majority of the apartments will be for those earning 60 percent of AMI.\\nMiami-Dade’s annual AMI is $79,400, the Florida Housing Finance Corporation shows. To qualify for a unit designated for tenants at the 60 percent AMI bracket, a one-person household can’t earn more than $47,700, and a two-person household can’t earn more than $54,480.\\nCentennial paid $875,000 for the five-lot vacant development site in 2019, records show.\\nThe firm is asking the county for an administrative site plan review. It originally filed a request for a pre-application meeting in December.\\nSwezy focuses on affordable housing, mainly using the state tax credit program that awards developers tax credits that they sell to investors and use the proceeds to finance projects. Centennial’s portfolio spans more than 3,500 affordable units.\\n\\nIn recent proposals, Swezy filed an application to Miami-Dade last summer for an\\neight-story, 132-unit\\nage-restricted building at 13841 Southwest 252nd Street in the Princeton neighborhood.\\nTax credits and other state and municipal government financing mechanisms make\\naffordable housing\\nmore resilient to elevated interest rates. While higher rates and other economic headwinds have\\npaused\\nsome planned\\nmultifamily\\nprojects, affordable rental development has continued. Also, demand is nearly ensured as many South Floridians are priced out of market-rate apartments due to\\nrecord rent\\nhikes in 2021 and 2022.\\nAffordable housing also has proved a boon for developers. Last month, Swezy paid\\n$14.8 million\\nfor a six-bedroom Fisher Island home at 6923 Valencia Drive. He bought it from the widow of the late Russian real estate tycoon Dmitry Zelenov.\\nDeveloper Michael Swerdlow wants to redevelop five Miami-Dade public housing complexes with\\n5,730\\naffordable and workforce apartments. On Tuesday, a county committee approved the project that would replace existing public housing complexes Victory Homes at 520 Northwest 75th Street, Newberg at 7200 Northeast Miami Court, Gwen Cherry 22 at 7101 Northeast Miami Court, Gwen Cherry 06 at the intersection of Northwest 71st Street and Northwest First Court, and New Haven Gardens at 7200 Northeast Second Avenue in Miami.\\nThe Pérez family’s Related Group plans an\\neight-story, 98-unit\\nbuilding at 5350 West Flagler Street in Miami’s Flagami. All units will be for households earning up to 30 percent of AMI.\\nAffordable housing developers also have seized on the Live Local Act, a state law that allows bigger projects than permitted by a site’s zoning and also grants property tax breaks to developers.\\nRussell Galbut’s GFO Investments family office proposes a\\n410-unit Live Local Act project\\nwith a 19-story and a 16-story building at 7350 Coral Way in Miami-Dade’s Corral Terrace neighborhood. Dr. Jorge Perez, who specializes in neonatology and neonatal medicine, is a partner on the development and will lease a seven-story medical office building part of the project.\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'Haley Hospitality Enterprises has snapped up a 121-room hotel in Laguna Hills for nearly $17 million after selling a hotel in Costa Mesa at a hefty profit for a hotel-to-residential conversion.\\nThe Lake Forest-based hospitality firm led by Bhavesh Ahir bought the three-story Laguna Hills Lodge at 23932 Paseo De Valencia,\\nthe Orange County Business Journal\\nreported, citing CoStar. The seller was locally based LHMLP.\\nThe deal works out to nearly $140,500 per room. Brokers Oliver Shah and Justin Myers of Atlas Hospitality Group represented the buyers. It’s not clear what LHMLP paid for the property, and when.\\nThe 87,500-square-foot economy class hotel, built in 1968, is near Interstate 5 at El Toro Road. Its rooms were recently offered for discount rates for refugees of January’s fires in Pacific Palisades and Altadena.\\nHotel sales in central and south OC have cooled, according to CoStar. Sales between Newport Beach and Dana Point were $125 million during the last “volume year,” compared to a three-year average of $340 million a year.\\nThe market didn’t prevent Haley from doing well in its sale late last year of a 120-room Travelodge by Wyndham Orange County Airport/ Costa Mesa at 1400 Bristol Street\\nIn December, the county agreed to buy the Travelodge from Haley for conversion into homeless housing under the state’s\\nProject Homekey program\\n. The hotel purchase and conversion into 78 supported apartments was to cost\\n$45 million\\n.\\n\\nThe $45 million redevelopment project, dubbed Homekey Bristol, included a $4 million contribution from Costa Mesa and $3 million from neighboring Newport Beach. Orange County kicked in $7 million and nearly 50 project-based vouchers. The grants totalled\\n$14 million\\n.\\nThe bulk of the money came from a Project Homekey grant from the state Department of Housing and Community Development, which kicked in\\n$29 million\\nfor the project led by American Family Housing. The Midway City-based nonprofit developer was to revamp the motel and run it as supportive housing.\\nSuch grants generally cover the purchase of the property. In the case of the Travelodge, that means Haley likely sold the 120-room hotel for $29 million, or $241,667 per room.\\nHaley Hospitality bought the Travelodge, built in 1970, in 2021 for\\n$14 million\\n, or $116,667 per room, according to the Central OC Times. The purchase came at the height of the pandemic, when the\\nhotel industry tanked\\nwhile\\ntens of thousands of rooms\\nwent dark.\\nThree years later, the county, via a grant from the state, bought the 54-year-old motor inn for a 107 percent markup for its last traded price. And Haley walked away with a windfall.\\n—\\nDana Bartholomew\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'Haley Hospitality Enterprises has snapped up a 121-room hotel in Laguna Hills for nearly $17 million after selling a hotel in Costa Mesa at a hefty profit for a hotel-to-residential conversion.\\nThe Lake Forest-based hospitality firm led by Bhavesh Ahir bought the three-story Laguna Hills Lodge at 23932 Paseo De Valencia,\\nthe Orange County Business Journal\\nreported, citing CoStar. The seller was locally based LHMLP.\\nThe deal works out to nearly $140,500 per room. Brokers Oliver Shah and Justin Myers of Atlas Hospitality Group represented the buyers. It’s not clear what LHMLP paid for the property, and when.\\nThe 87,500-square-foot economy class hotel, built in 1968, is near Interstate 5 at El Toro Road. Its rooms were recently offered for discount rates for refugees of January’s fires in Pacific Palisades and Altadena.\\nHotel sales in central and south OC have cooled, according to CoStar. Sales between Newport Beach and Dana Point were $125 million during the last “volume year,” compared to a three-year average of $340 million a year.\\nThe market didn’t prevent Haley from doing well in its sale late last year of a 120-room Travelodge by Wyndham Orange County Airport/ Costa Mesa at 1400 Bristol Street\\nIn December, the county agreed to buy the Travelodge from Haley for conversion into homeless housing under the state’s\\nProject Homekey program\\n. The hotel purchase and conversion into 78 supported apartments was to cost\\n$45 million\\n.\\n\\nThe $45 million redevelopment project, dubbed Homekey Bristol, included a $4 million contribution from Costa Mesa and $3 million from neighboring Newport Beach. Orange County kicked in $7 million and nearly 50 project-based vouchers. The grants totalled\\n$14 million\\n.\\nThe bulk of the money came from a Project Homekey grant from the state Department of Housing and Community Development, which kicked in\\n$29 million\\nfor the project led by American Family Housing. The Midway City-based nonprofit developer was to revamp the motel and run it as supportive housing.\\nSuch grants generally cover the purchase of the property. In the case of the Travelodge, that means Haley likely sold the 120-room hotel for $29 million, or $241,667 per room.\\nHaley Hospitality bought the Travelodge, built in 1970, in 2021 for\\n$14 million\\n, or $116,667 per room, according to the Central OC Times. The purchase came at the height of the pandemic, when the\\nhotel industry tanked\\nwhile\\ntens of thousands of rooms\\nwent dark.\\nThree years later, the county, via a grant from the state, bought the 54-year-old motor inn for a 107 percent markup for its last traded price. And Haley walked away with a windfall.\\n—\\nDana Bartholomew\\n',\n",

In such a case, more time would no doubt be tacked onto efforts to quickly rehouse those who wish to return to homes damaged or destroyed by the fires.\\nBuilder’s remedy claims another win, this time in foothills\\nSticking with the subject of building, this week brought more news for housing proponents by way of builder’s remedy.\\nA legal battle between a proposed mixed-use development and the\\ncity of La Cañada Flintridge\\nis over. City officials gave up fighting the project, which would have consisted of apartments, hotel rooms and over 7,300 square feet of office space at 600 Foothill Boulevard.\\n\\nDeveloper Cedar Street used the builder’s remedy loophole in state housing law to bypass city zoning requirements in exchange for including low-income homes. The city pushed back. However, a judge’s order to either pay a $14 million bond or back off resulted in the latter by the city.\\nLa Cañada Flintridge is the latest example in a rising tension playing out publicly between state and local governments.\\nResi’s whopping land listing\\nIntrigue abounds around who might buy a\\n$175 million, multi-parcel land listing\\n.\\nThe 33 acres, spread across 15 parcels in Benedict Canyon comes with a controversial past. Developer Gary Safady once aimed to build on site a Bulgari-branded hotel with 59 rooms, plus eight single-family residences ranging in size from 12,000 to 48,000 square feet.\\nThe proposed project was axed in 2023 after then-planning director Vincent Bertoni caved to pressure from project critics and wrote a letter to Safady that called out project impacts well beyond what the city originally expected.\\nSafady pulled a $30 million loan on the property from Motcomb Estates, the real estate investment arm for the Reuben Brothers. Records show Safady defaulted on the loan in November with Motcomb alleging a nearly $50 million unpaid balance at the time, pushing the parcels to the sales block.\\nIt’s unclear whether another developer might have a go at the property and buy it for purposes of another project. Any proposal is likely to face much of the same scrutiny Safady had in moving the Bulgari Resort Los Angeles forward.\\nKeeping up with the OC\\nCompared to a $175 million listing, the $16.3 million trade of a Laguna Niguel mansion may seem small. However, the closing marked an all-time record for the city.\\nThe sale of the Spanish-style mansion in the gated community of Bear Brand Ranch also set a price-per-square-foot record in Laguna Niguel. The home at\\n7 Searidge\\npenciled out to $1,993 per square foot. That’s well beyond the $625-per-square-foot held by the city’s former residential record: a two-lot deal that closed in 2014 for $15 million.\\nAs Orange County sees more unique developments come online, such as Almquist’s River Street Marketplace in San Juan Capistrano, it’s helping lend an air of cool and renewed desirability in the residential communities south of Los Angeles County.\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'State Farm General got its wish to hike home insurance rates by an average of 22 percent.\\nThe news comes weeks after being\\nstraight-armed\\nby California’s chief insurance regulator for a request to increase rates because of the Los Angeles wildfires.\\nCalifornia Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara “provisionally” granted the unit of Illinois-based State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance the emergency rate increase requested after billions in wildfire claims,\\nthe Los Angeles Times reported\\n.\\nBut the increase — which includes a 38 percent rate increase for rental buildings and 15 percent for renters and condo owners — won’t take effect until a hearing slated for April 8.\\nLara approved the increase on March 14 after\\nturning down the request last month\\n, saying the insurer had failed to prove it was warranted.\\nHe’d given the insurer an opportunity, however, to provide more evidence to justify the request.\\nIn making his decision, Lara called on State Farm to halt any pending nonrenewals of customers statewide and for the insurer’s parent company to provide its California insurer an infusion of $500 million to stabilize its capital position, according to the Times.\\n“The role of insurance commissioner involves balancing a stable and sustainable insurance market that serves consumers with effective oversight,” he said in a statement. “To ensure long-term choices for Californians, I had to make an unprecedented decision in the short term.”\\n“The facts will be revealed in an open, transparent hearing,” he added.\\n\\nState Farm has faced years of losses and huge damage claims after the\\nJan. 7 fires\\nthat raged Pacific Palisades to Altadena, and leveled more than 12,000 homes.\\nAs of March 11, State Farm General and its parent have received more than 12,000 fire and auto claims related to the wildfires, and paid\\nmore than $2.2 billion to customers\\n.\\nState Farm General has estimated it will pay out $7.9 billion in the wake of the Palisades, Eaton and other L.A. County fires.\\nBut, its net losses from the fires will be closer to $600 million after reinsurance payments, which largely will come from its parent company. Reinsurance is bought by insurers from other insurers to protect themselves from catastrophic events.\\nLast March, the company announced it would\\nnot renew 72,000 home, apartment and other property policies\\nin California, citing wildfire risks and other concerns.\\nThat followed a\\ndecision in May 2023\\nto stop writing insurance for new businesses, homeowners, and other personal property and casualties in the state, with the exception of personal auto policies.\\nIn June, State Farm\\nrequested a 30 percent rate increase for its homeowners policies\\n, as well as other rate hikes, which await a decision. The request took state officials by surprise, with Lara saying it raised “serious questions about its financial condition.”\\nState Farm General last month said it’s lost $2.8 billion over the last nine years, including gains from investment income. State Farm Group, led by State Farm General’s parent company, was given a superior financial rating in December by a rating agency.\\n—\\nDana Bartholomew\\n',\n",

Talks with one potential bidder are ongoing\\nForever 21 reported to the state it would be closing eight stores across Southern California — but the closures appear to be more widespread, with hundreds of employees to hit the bricks, according to the Register.\\nThe official closures include stores at the The Outlets at Orange, Main Place Mall in Santa Ana, Galleria at Tyler Mall in Riverside, Ontario Mills in Ontario, Victoria Gardens in Rancho Cucamonga, Montclair Place in Montclair, Lakewood Center Mall and at Los Cerritos Mall\\nThe company said the layoffs and store closures are permanent, beginning April 25 and continuing through May 9, letters submitted to California’s Employment Development Department.\\n\\nReaders of the Register also reported stores at Westfield Fashion Square in Sherman Oaks, The Shops at Santa Anita in Arcadia, South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, Promenade Temecula and Inland Center in San Bernardino had closing signs on their storefront windows.\\nThe company,\\nwith 58 stores in California\\n, announced in February that it would shutter at least 200 stores nationwide.\\nThe retailer was founded in 1984 by husband and wife Do Won and Jin Sook Chang as Fashion 21, in Los Angeles, with its first store on Figueroa Street.\\nRenamed Forever 21, the chain grew into a nationwide brand known for its trendy and cheap clothing for teens and 20-somethings. At its peak in 2015, the company reported $4.4 billion in sales and 1,300 stores worldwide.\\nBut over the years, the company faced numerous controversies, including accusations of wage theft, the use of cadmium in its jewelry, controversial slogans on T-shirts and the cheap labor used abroad to sew its clothing.\\nIn 2020, its assets were sold in bankruptcy for $81 million to a group of investors that included Authentic Brands Group, Simon Properties and Brookfield Properties. That group, known as SPARC, owned retail brands including Lucky, Eddie Bauer, Aeropostale, Brooks Brothers and Nautica.\\nIn January, SPARC said\\nit was merging with JCPenney\\n, creating a new group called Catalyst Brands, which left off Forever 21 from its list of brands. Instead, the company said it was seeking a new operator for the retailer.\\nToday, fast fashion in the U.S. has been overrun with competition from Chinese e-commerce companies such as Temu and Shein, which produce and sell items for pennies, according to the Register.\\n—\\nDana Bartholomew\\n',\n",

Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta\\nasked a court\\nto support the project, as well as the state builder’s remedy provision.\\nThe decision by the city to back down sends a disquieting message to cities trying to push back against housing laws, Ryan Leaderman, a partner at Holland &amp; Knight, who previously represented the 600 Foothill project, told Bisnow.\\n“The message is: stop playing games with housing,” Leaderman said. “There’s going to be a price to pay when a city unlawfully denies a project.”\\nDespite the city’s decision to abandon its appeal, the Foothill Boulevard project must still clear several hurdles before winning local approval. While the builder’s remedy waives zoning rules, such projects still must comply with environmental, infrastructure and health and safety standards, according to the Daily News.\\n“The City and community will need to chart a pathway forward that integrates the 600 Foothill project as reasonably as possible, and we hope going forward the developer will work with us to minimize any detrimental impacts on the City,” Mayor Davitt said in his statement.\\n“The ball’s in their court,” Cedar Street partner Jonathan Curtis told Bisnow.\\n—\\nDana Bartholomew\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'Office properties hit hard by the pandemic often end up in the hands of their lenders or bargain-hunting buyers before they get a chance at a revival.\\nYet for a West Loop office portfolio that plunged from 90 to 50 percent occupied, co-owner R2 has managed to remain in the drivers’ seat and go debt-free through a new partnership. Public records show its joint venture with Beltway Capital Management — finalized last month with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure that took its former co-owner Heitman out of the picture — also adds a fifth building to the 350,000-square-foot portfolio.\\nR2 bought six West Loop loft office buildings in 2016 for $86 million in a joint venture with Chicago-based Walton Street Capital. R2 later recapitalized a four-building portion of the portfolio in a joint venture with Chicago-based Heitman in 2019. The Heitman venture paid $65 million for the portfolio with a $42 million loan from Truist Financial. It’s unclear how much R2 paid to maintain its stake in the properties.\\nThe joint venture struggled to hold onto the four assets, located at 641 West Lake Street, 901 West Jackson Boulevard and 130 South Jefferson Street, after the pandemic hit.\\nMaryland-based Beltway, which specializes in buying distressed debt, bought the loan note from Truist last May, when the properties and their owners faced a murky path forward. The loan was labeled nonperforming at the time of its sale, meaning it likely traded for less than its face value.\\nIt’s not uncommon for distressed debt buyers to file foreclosure actions shortly after acquiring a struggling loan.\\nWhen Truist put the $42 million debt on the market, R2 and Heitman hadn’t technically defaulted on the loan, but it was in cash management, people familiar with the offering said. That means its excess cash flow was being used to cover debt service costs.\\nIn this case, Beltway tapped R2 as its partner in managing the assets. R2 CEO Matt Garrison declined to share how much the firm invested into the portfolio to maintain its stake or what terms dictated Heitman’s departure from the joint venture.\\nRepresentatives of Heitman did not respond to requests for comment.\\nGarrison said R2 will be investing in “aggressive retention efforts for existing tenants,” and upgrades to common areas.\\n\\nIt was worth it for R2 to hang onto the assets because loft offices are often the type of buildings targeted for residential conversions, he said, meaning the number of competing properties could dwindle. Others aren’t in a position to fund the costs of competing for tenants.\\n“Many of the (loft office) owners are undercapitalized or lack a rationale to invest capital in new leases, because their properties are worth less than the debt,” Garrison said. “This makes the effective inventory even smaller. We think there will always be demand for well executed loft buildings in the West Loop, and supply and demand looks better today for the right buildings than it has in a long time.”\\nA few months before it bought the distressed note from Truist, Beltway also pounced on another struggling loan issued by Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada to the Feil Organization for a loft office building at 730 North Franklin Street. Beltway also partnered with R2 to take over that asset.\\nNow the firms co-own all five properties outright. Debt-free buildings\\nhave emerged as an appealing strategy\\nfor office investors seeking flexibility in making significant building upgrades and attracting tenants with competitive lease terms.\\n“Debt is just financial engineering. It isn’t required from this entry basis to generate great returns,” Garrison said. “One of the first questions tenant reps ask is about debt. Is the building in trouble, etc. Owning a property in all cash is the best answer to this question.”\\nWhether the new approach will kickstart a turnaround for the full portfolio remains to be seen.\\nThe office at 901 West Jackson is 90 percent occupied but the offices at 641 West\\xa0 Lake and 130 South Jefferson are 50 percent occupied. Garrison said the firm is negotiating several leases across the properties.\\n“In the office business, it is hard to stay flat,” he said. “You are either growing or you are declining. The Chicago office market is really two markets today, with almost half of the buildings effectively offline.”\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'Hamilton Partners is maneuvering to save a struggling suburban Chicago office deal without getting much help from its distressed ownership companion, Accesso Partners, which faces foreclosures at a handful of properties in the area.\\nItasca-based Hamilton is a minority owner of the Esplanade I, a 609,000-square-foot office complex at 2001 Butterfield Road in Downers Grove, a property that had its $69 million loan transferred last month to special servicer CW Capital, a sign of financial trouble for the landlord.\\nAccesso, based in the Miami suburb of Hallandale Beach, has the larger ownership stake in the 19-story property of the two firms, but it’s either unable or unwilling to commit the capital necessary to work out the debt trouble alongside Hamilton, said Hamilton partner Ron Lunt.\\nAs a result, Hamilton is seeking to delay the maturity of the property’s loan, which comes due in July of next year, and is starting debt workout talks with CW Capital around how to fund the costs of turning the property around, such as tenant allowances for workspace buildouts and leasing broker commissions, Lunt said.\\n“We have some lease talks going, but if we’re going to spend a ton of money, we would like to work out an extension of some sort,” Lunt said. “Offices are low priority for lenders today, which is why you need to start the discussion early.”\\nCW Capital declared the loan is headed toward “imminent monetary default,” although Lunt said the loan terms were only breached on a technicality because its previous loan servicer, Iowa-based Principal, was allowing rents to be collected and debt costs to be paid later in the month than the special servicer.\\nCW is reviewing Hamilton’s request for a modification to the deal terms, and it’s unclear when it will come to a resolution. Accesso, meanwhile, will have its equity in the property diluted further with each dollar Hamilton kicks into the deal as it attempts to rescue the loan from the brink of distress, Lunt said.\\nAccesso didn’t return requests for comment. It surrendered its office tower at 20 North Clark Street in the Chicago Loop to its lender earlier this year, and it is also facing a\\n$75 million foreclosure at 200 West Monroe Street\\n, which is next door to a property the firm previously sold at a major loss from its previous purchase price. Accesso made other\\nsuburban office investments that recently ended up in foreclosure\\n, too. The firm bought several of those properties from Hamilton, and entered the Esplanade deal in a 2015 joint venture.\\nAccesso also lost a\\nHouston office portfolio\\nto financial distress last year.\\n\\nThe suburban Chicago property was appraised at $105 million ($172 per square foot) in 2016, when the joint venture’s commercial mortgage-backed securities loan was originated. That’s far more than what it’s likely worth today as interest rates and subdued demand from tenants have eaten into property values. The loan’s $57.3 million balance pencils out to $94 per square foot.\\nThe property’s financial trouble was triggered in part by the 2023 exit of Hillshire Brands, an affiliate of Tyson Foods, that previously leased a 72,000-square-foot annex building that serves as a research and development facility on the Downers Grove campus.\\nThat space hasn’t been refilled, and the asset is only 72 percent leased, about average for suburban Chicago office buildings amid one of the worst downturns of all time for the sector. The lackluster occupancy has sunk the property’s revenue to well below the level required to meet debt service obligations, public loan data shows.\\nThe property’s debt-service coverage ratio was just 0.43 for 2024 through the end of September, loan data compiled by Morningstar Credit shows — anything less than 1.0 is below breakeven, meaning the Esplanade property was bringing in less than half the rent needed to cover its costs.\\nStill, Hamilton is working with a brokerage team focused on food processing companies to help lease the space Hillshire vacated, with the hope it can get the deal back on track in time to dodge penalties with its lender.\\nYet it’ll be vying for tenants with other office properties in the suburbs that have already been through foreclosure or deeply discounted sales in\\nnearby suburban markets\\n, allowing their buyers to offer lower rents in some cases, Lunt noted.\\n“Major projects in\\nSchaumburg\\nhave gone through ownership changes and the bases are all reset, and it makes it tougher competition,” Lunt said.\\n',\n",

Public records show its joint venture with Beltway Capital Management — finalized last month with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure that took its former co-owner Heitman out of the picture — also adds a fifth building to the 350,000-square-foot portfolio.\\nR2 bought six West Loop loft office buildings in 2016 for $86 million in a joint venture with Chicago-based Walton Street Capital. R2 later recapitalized a four-building portion of the portfolio in a joint venture with Chicago-based Heitman in 2019. The Heitman venture paid $65 million for the portfolio with a $42 million loan from Truist Financial. It’s unclear how much R2 paid to maintain its stake in the properties.\\nThe joint venture struggled to hold onto the four assets, located at 641 West Lake Street, 901 West Jackson Boulevard and 130 South Jefferson Street, after the pandemic hit.\\nMaryland-based Beltway, which specializes in buying distressed debt, bought the loan note from Truist last May, when the properties and their owners faced a murky path forward. The loan was labeled nonperforming at the time of its sale, meaning it likely traded for less than its face value.\\nIt’s not uncommon for distressed debt buyers to file foreclosure actions shortly after acquiring a struggling loan.\\nWhen Truist put the $42 million debt on the market, R2 and Heitman hadn’t technically defaulted on the loan, but it was in cash management, people familiar with the offering said. That means its excess cash flow was being used to cover debt service costs.\\nIn this case, Beltway tapped R2 as its partner in managing the assets. R2 CEO Matt Garrison declined to share how much the firm invested into the portfolio to maintain its stake or what terms dictated Heitman’s departure from the joint venture.\\nRepresentatives of Heitman did not respond to requests for comment.\\nGarrison said R2 will be investing in “aggressive retention efforts for existing tenants,” and upgrades to common areas.\\n\\nIt was worth it for R2 to hang onto the assets because loft offices are often the type of buildings targeted for residential conversions, he said, meaning the number of competing properties could dwindle. Others aren’t in a position to fund the costs of competing for tenants.\\n“Many of the (loft office) owners are undercapitalized or lack a rationale to invest capital in new leases, because their properties are worth less than the debt,” Garrison said. “This makes the effective inventory even smaller. We think there will always be demand for well executed loft buildings in the West Loop, and supply and demand looks better today for the right buildings than it has in a long time.”\\nA few months before it bought the distressed note from Truist, Beltway also pounced on another struggling loan issued by Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada to the Feil Organization for a loft office building at 730 North Franklin Street. Beltway also partnered with R2 to take over that asset.\\nNow the firms co-own all five properties outright. Debt-free buildings\\nhave emerged as an appealing strategy\\nfor office investors seeking flexibility in making significant building upgrades and attracting tenants with competitive lease terms.\\n“Debt is just financial engineering. It isn’t required from this entry basis to generate great returns,” Garrison said. “One of the first questions tenant reps ask is about debt. Is the building in trouble, etc. Owning a property in all cash is the best answer to this question.”\\nWhether the new approach will kickstart a turnaround for the full portfolio remains to be seen.\\nThe office at 901 West Jackson is 90 percent occupied but the offices at 641 West\\xa0 Lake and 130 South Jefferson are 50 percent occupied. Garrison said the firm is negotiating several leases across the properties.\\n“In the office business, it is hard to stay flat,” he said. “You are either growing or you are declining. The Chicago office market is really two markets today, with almost half of the buildings effectively offline.”\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'Hamilton Partners is maneuvering to save a struggling suburban Chicago office deal without getting much help from its distressed ownership companion, Accesso Partners, which faces foreclosures at a handful of properties in the area.\\nItasca-based Hamilton is a minority owner of the Esplanade I, a 609,000-square-foot office complex at 2001 Butterfield Road in Downers Grove, a property that had its $69 million loan transferred last month to special servicer CW Capital, a sign of financial trouble for the landlord.\\nAccesso, based in the Miami suburb of Hallandale Beach, has the larger ownership stake in the 19-story property of the two firms, but it’s either unable or unwilling to commit the capital necessary to work out the debt trouble alongside Hamilton, said Hamilton partner Ron Lunt.\\nAs a result, Hamilton is seeking to delay the maturity of the property’s loan, which comes due in July of next year, and is starting debt workout talks with CW Capital around how to fund the costs of turning the property around, such as tenant allowances for workspace buildouts and leasing broker commissions, Lunt said.\\n“We have some lease talks going, but if we’re going to spend a ton of money, we would like to work out an extension of some sort,” Lunt said. “Offices are low priority for lenders today, which is why you need to start the discussion early.”\\nCW Capital declared the loan is headed toward “imminent monetary default,” although Lunt said the loan terms were only breached on a technicality because its previous loan servicer, Iowa-based Principal, was allowing rents to be collected and debt costs to be paid later in the month than the special servicer.\\nCW is reviewing Hamilton’s request for a modification to the deal terms, and it’s unclear when it will come to a resolution. Accesso, meanwhile, will have its equity in the property diluted further with each dollar Hamilton kicks into the deal as it attempts to rescue the loan from the brink of distress, Lunt said.\\nAccesso didn’t return requests for comment. It surrendered its office tower at 20 North Clark Street in the Chicago Loop to its lender earlier this year, and it is also facing a\\n$75 million foreclosure at 200 West Monroe Street\\n, which is next door to a property the firm previously sold at a major loss from its previous purchase price. Accesso made other\\nsuburban office investments that recently ended up in foreclosure\\n, too. The firm bought several of those properties from Hamilton, and entered the Esplanade deal in a 2015 joint venture.\\nAccesso also lost a\\nHouston office portfolio\\nto financial distress last year.\\n\\nThe suburban Chicago property was appraised at $105 million ($172 per square foot) in 2016, when the joint venture’s commercial mortgage-backed securities loan was originated. That’s far more than what it’s likely worth today as interest rates and subdued demand from tenants have eaten into property values. The loan’s $57.3 million balance pencils out to $94 per square foot.\\nThe property’s financial trouble was triggered in part by the 2023 exit of Hillshire Brands, an affiliate of Tyson Foods, that previously leased a 72,000-square-foot annex building that serves as a research and development facility on the Downers Grove campus.\\nThat space hasn’t been refilled, and the asset is only 72 percent leased, about average for suburban Chicago office buildings amid one of the worst downturns of all time for the sector. The lackluster occupancy has sunk the property’s revenue to well below the level required to meet debt service obligations, public loan data shows.\\nThe property’s debt-service coverage ratio was just 0.43 for 2024 through the end of September, loan data compiled by Morningstar Credit shows — anything less than 1.0 is below breakeven, meaning the Esplanade property was bringing in less than half the rent needed to cover its costs.\\nStill, Hamilton is working with a brokerage team focused on food processing companies to help lease the space Hillshire vacated, with the hope it can get the deal back on track in time to dodge penalties with its lender.\\nYet it’ll be vying for tenants with other office properties in the suburbs that have already been through foreclosure or deeply discounted sales in\\nnearby suburban markets\\n, allowing their buyers to offer lower rents in some cases, Lunt noted.\\n“Major projects in\\nSchaumburg\\nhave gone through ownership changes and the bases are all reset, and it makes it tougher competition,” Lunt said.\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi has fixed hundreds of property misclassifications after a months-long audit, but questions remain over how many errors are still unresolved.\\nAt least 620 properties were\\nmisclassified or undervalued\\nduring the 2023 tax year, resulting in an estimated $444 million in missed taxable value.\\nThe assessor’s office has since corrected 491 of those errors, adding nearly $489 million in taxable value to county rolls — about 17 percent of the new construction value added countywide in 2023, the Chicago Tribune\\nreported\\n. An investigation by Illinois Answers and the outlet reported the misclassified properties last year.\\nStill, 129 properties identified in the investigation remain incorrectly classified, with fixes delayed due to a backlog at the Cook County Board of Review and what Kaegi’s office described as “quirks in the tax calendar.”\\nThe office also blamed inconsistent permit data from local municipalities as a key factor behind delayed corrections.\\nThe misclassifications carried major financial consequences.\\nSome homeowners, like those in suburban Lynwood, have already received back tax bills as high as $23,000 after belated reassessments. State law allows for up to three years of back taxes, though Kaegi’s office maintains that it won’t issue back taxes in cases where it failed to act on construction permits it had on file.\\nIn 46 out of 55 back-taxed cases, Kaegi’s office did have relevant permit information, but missed it.\\n\\nMany affected properties were either new construction or had undergone significant renovations, but the assessor’s records failed to reflect those changes. In some cases, properties were still being taxed based on outdated classifications.\\nFor instance, a home in Gilmore Park built in 2021 and sold for $843,000 continued to be assessed as a vacant lot, with its value listed at less than $45,000.\\nKaegi’s office has since hired a dozen more staffers, including two permit specialists and 10 field inspectors, and promoted a veteran staffer to oversee data integrity. The office also plans to launch a sales validation team this year to help catch discrepancies, such as multimillion-dollar sales on properties incorrectly recorded as vacant.\\nKaegi is pushing for broader systemic changes.\\nLast week, he\\ncalled on the Federal Housing Finance Agency\\nto release appraisal data from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to local assessors. Kaegi argued that access to this data —\\ncurrently restricted\\n— would help improve the accuracy of property assessments, particularly in addressing long-standing issues like regressivity, where lower-value homes are often over-assessed relative to their market value. His office released a public dataset on Monday morning with building permits submitted to the office by municipalities, another bid to bring transparency to the process.\\nCritics argue the long delays and lingering errors undermine confidence in Cook County’s property tax system — especially when homeowners can be hit with massive, unexpected tax bills for mistakes they had no hand in.\\nKaegi’s office is reviewing the 46 back tax bills for errors, as delays in delivering the permits to the assessor’s office can slow its ability to make corrections, a spokesperson said.\\n— Judah Duke\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'Hines, Chris Kennedy of a famous American political family and their investment partners in a 60-story skyscraper in Chicago have defied the pandemic-induced downturn for commercial office space.\\nThe owners of\\nSalesforce Tower\\non the bank of the Chicago River are nearing the finalization of a $610 million long-term debt deal, marking a milestone in the aftermath of the pandemic-stricken economy, CoStar News\\nreported\\n. Should the deal close later this month as expected, the property — developed by Hines and the Kennedy family as well as the AFL-CIO’s real estate investment arm — will stand as a contrarian bet that worked out amid economic uncertainty.\\nThe commercial mortgage-backed securities loan reflects the tower’s long-term valuation of $888 million, as appraised by Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Its current valuation of $745 million is expected to rise further following the repayment of tenant-improvement costs and free rent allowances.\\nThe refinancing package, with Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs serving as the lenders, will replace the property’s $549 million construction debt and is projected to carry an interest rate of 6.525 percent until its maturity in March 2030.\\nConceived during the early days of the pandemic, Salesforce Tower has upended market trends by maintaining high occupancy levels, with leases covering over 95 percent of its 1.2 million square feet. Key tenants include Salesforce, which rents more than 477,000 square feet, and Kirkland &amp; Ellis, which is on a 677,000-square-foot lease; those deals run into the 2040s.\\n\\nMeanwhile, much of the rest of the Chicago office market is depressed, with record-high vacancy rates of more than 25 percent and\\nmassive foreclosure lawsuits\\nagainst office landlords winding through Cook County court.\\nFor the Salesforce Tower developers and Chicago’s broader office market, scoring the loan is a testament to the investment thesis that the world’s largest companies remain interested in ultra-premium workspace and aren’t afraid to invest heavily in it as a method to attract and retain top talent. Kirkland has poured over $207 million beyond its tenant-improvement allowance to create its ideal workspaces, while Salesforce has put up an additional $78 million for its interior buildout, the Moody’s report cited by the outlet shows.\\nMoody’s put out a robust outlook on the deal, buoyed by a net operating income projected to reach about $51.2 million by the second year of the loan.\\nEastdil Secured arranged the financing package for Salesforce Tower.\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'The developer with ambitious plans for the Bronzeville Lakefront put pictures with its pitch for a Chicago Bears stadium, although the team’s plans are far from certain.\\nFarpoint Development released renderings for a $3.2 billion domed stadium on the 49-acre site of the former Michael Reese hospital on the South Side, aiming to present an alternative to the team’s two other options, Crain’s\\nreported\\n. The team is also considering a redevelopment of the Arlington Heights racetrack and a domed stadium near Soldier Field.\\nThe Bronzeville pitch includes an entertainment district, hotels and a 20-acre park bridging over Lake Shore Drive, connecting the stadium to the lakefront, proximity to which has been one of the National Football League team’s main requirements.\\nThe developer argues the site offers the best of both worlds: an urban core location and room for ancillary developments — retail, dining and multifamily projects — that could generate additional revenue for the team.\\nThe stadium would be privately financed by the Bears, but the developer is pitching $600 million in state infrastructure funds to prepare the site for development, including utilities, roads and environmental work.\\nThat departs from\\nthe Bears’ other lakefront proposal\\n, which sought a $900 million upfront public subsidy. By financing the stadium privately, developers see the plan as more palatable to political leaders wary of direct public subsidies.\\n\\nStill, hurdles remain. The Bears haven’t publicly engaged with the proposal as of late, but\\nrescinded a rejection in the fall\\nafter Farpoint updated its plans to take out a conflict with Metra tracks it previously planned to build over.\\nInsiders suggest the team is still focused on either advancing its lakefront vision or moving forward in Arlington Heights. The narrow footprint of the Michael Reese site has also raised concerns about feasibility.\\nAnother complication is the adjacent Prairie Shores apartment complex, partially owned by Farpoint. The developer says the stadium could fit without impacting the complex, but demolishing units has been floated as a way to maximize the site — an option that would likely draw political pushback.\\nThe city still owns the majority of the site and would need to contribute land, as well as cover about $40 million in debt tied to its acquisition. Public financing could also come from tax increment financing and leveraging the site’s federal opportunity zone status.\\n— Judah Duke\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'A venture involving Zell Kravinsky’s Morning Sky Capital scooped up a 63-unit apartment complex on the bank of the Fox River in the northwest suburbs of Chicago from multifamily giant Greg Fowler’s firm, which previously bought it out of distress.\\nKravinsky’s company partnered with several other investors to pay $19.3 million for the ReNew on Main property at 1 North Main Street in Algonquin, public records show. The price of $302,000 per unit included assuming an existing mortgage with a balance of more than $11 million that the San Francisco-based seller, FPA Multifamily, previously took out on the property, sparing the buyer from shopping for debt at today’s elevated interest rates.\\nFor FPA, one of Chicagoland’s largest multifamily landlords, the deal extends a streak of activity in the area that has tended to follow the same pattern: the firm is\\nselling off its smaller assets\\nand buying up bigger ones with funds the transactions generate. The Algonquin deal closed right as\\nFPA bought a 356-unit Naperville apartment complex\\nfor $68 million, in another deal where it assumed the existing debt of the seller, Chicago-based Rockwell Partners.\\n“There is not a lot of liquidity in the market right now, which is good for people who have a conviction in the market and are ready to make a bet,” said Morning Sky’s Lev Kravinsky. “In general most of what we’re buying nowadays is either all cash or loan assumption. It’s difficult but not impossible to find deals that pencil with fresh debt.”\\nFPA didn’t return a request for comment on the Algonquin transaction.\\nWhile the deal is relatively small for FPA, the seller posted a gain on the property after buying it out of distress in 2018 for $12.7 million ($201,600 per unit). The complex, which also includes six ground-floor retail units, has a checkered ownership history after running into delays during its development, and financial trouble after its 2011 completion.\\n\\nFPA bought it from a financial institution, Boston-based UC Funds, which acquired the property through foreclosure. The property was conceived as a 54-unit luxury condo project, awarded to Aspen Homebuilders back in 2006 by the village of Algonquin. Aspen went bankrupt two years later, and the firm’s owner, Bruce Hawkins, pleaded guilty in 2013 to defrauding a bank of more than $1 million, the Northwest Herald previously\\nreported\\n.\\nThe building remained unfinished for years, until developer John Bruegelmans took over the project in 2011 and gained approval to convert the project into rentals. Residents started moving in during 2015, but Buregelmans filed for bankruptcy in 2016 to restructure construction debt, the newspaper reported.\\nThat’s what prompted a UC Funds entity to take over the building and eventually sell it to FPA.\\nMeanwhile, buyers in Chicago and its suburban multifamily markets are\\nset to raise rents\\nin the coming year as new supply craters amid a development dropoff.\\nMorning Sky owns several other apartment complexes in the area, with three in the suburbs and one in the city, Lev Kravinsky said. His father, Morning Sky principal Zell Kravinsky, is well-known as a philanthropist and longtime real estate investor.\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi is pushing the federal government to release property appraisal data to the country’s largest assessors to help improve the accuracy of property tax assessments, which have received criticism locally for being systemically flawed.\\nA resolution sponsored by Kaegi calls for the Federal Housing Finance Agency to hand data containing “millions of property appraisals” over to 16 of the nation’s largest assessment offices, according to a news release.\\nThe assessor made the request just a day before the Senate on Thursday confirmed President Trump’s nominee\\nBill Pulte as head of the FHFA\\n, which collects appraisal records from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Pulte’s stance on Kaegi’s idea is unclear; Pulte is the grandson of the late William Pulte, who started one of the nation’s largest homebuilders, Pulte Homes, in Detroit in the 1950s.\\nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency compiles Fannie and Freddie appraisals into a Uniform Appraisal Dataset that contains parcel-level property characteristics. Most of this data is inaccessible to government assessors, but Kaegi and 15 other assessment offices across the country are hoping to change that.\\nThe Kaegi-backed proposal’s supporters said it would aid in addressing a common problem encountered by Cook County homeowners: Less expensive homes tend to be overvalued for taxes relative to their actual sale price, while pricier homes tend to be undervalued for taxes in an issue known as “regressivity.”\\n\\nThis means that working class and low income families end up paying more than their fair share in property taxes or can’t pay at all, putting a strain on the local municipality that relies on property tax revenue to fund public services. This has been\\nparticularly true for small towns in the South suburbs of Chicago\\nthat have a higher concentration of working class homeowners hit with overvaluations.\\n“In recent years, we’ve eliminated a large portion of the regressivity in Cook County’s residential assessments,” Kaegi said in the release. “With the release of this data, we would be able to clear one of the final hurdles to achieving thoroughly fair and accurate assessments.”\\nA 2022 University of Chicago\\nstudy cited the main causes of regressivity as “limitations in the data and methods used in assessment,” specifically a lack of data about property characteristics that might factor into calculating a property’s assessed value. A study by Josh Myers Valuation Solutions also attributed\\nthe undervaluation of commercial properties\\n, in part, to “lack of data-sharing.”\\nThe resolution got a boost from the National Association of Counties’ Board of Directors, which endorsed the measure in a March 1 annual legislative conference, according to the release. Kaegi’s co-sponsor on the bill is Eddie Cook, the assessor of Maricopa County, Arizona, which includes the city of Phoenix.\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'A LaSalle Street tower is hitting the market, but Chicago’s office market isn’t exactly dealing strong hands.\\nBeacon Capital Partners listed its 40-story office tower at 190 South LaSalle Street at a challenging moment for Chicago’s office sector, Crain’s\\nreported\\n.\\nThe property, known as the U.S. Bank Building, is facing potential tenant losses and mounting financial pressure. The price wasn’t disclosed.\\nBeacon acquired the nearly 800,000-square-foot tower in late 2019 for $230 million ($288 per square foot) and is selling at a time when Loop office buildings are trading at significant discounts. A $167.5 million mortgage ($209 per square foot) from U.S. Bank also weighs it down — a balance that now likely exceeds the property’s market value amid rising vacancies and declining demand.\\nTwo of the building’s largest tenants, Neuberger Berman and Bain &amp; Company, are expected to exit by 2027 and 2028, respectively.\\nThe looming vacancies add to the building’s uncertainty despite its anchor tenant U.S. Bank’s signing through 2030. The weighted average lease term across tenants is just over four years, according to marketing materials.\\n\\nThe sale offer comes after Beacon’s\\nloss on 303 East Wacker Drive\\n, which sold in December for about $63 million, a steep drop from the $182 million Beacon paid in 2018. Another blow came with a foreclosure lawsuit at 330 North Wabash Avenue, where Beacon faces claims over a $372 million loan after its appraisal\\ndropped 62 percent last month\\nfrom issuance four years ago.\\nBeacon recently invested $13.7 million in renovating 190 South LaSalle, upgrading the lobby, fitness center and conference spaces in hopes of attracting tenants.\\nThe building, developed in 1987 and designed by Philip Johnson, is one of the few LaSalle Street properties to undergo significant recent updates. That list includes 135 South LaSalle Street, for which the city doled out $98 million in TIF subsidies to Riverside Investment &amp; Development, DL3 Realty and AmTrust RE to convert vacant office space into 386 residential units\\nlast fall\\n.\\nSeveral nearby towers have fallen into foreclosure, like New York-based landlord Feil Organization’s 10 South LaSalle Street. Feil was\\nhit with a foreclosure suit\\nby Wilmington Trust in January over contractors’ unpaid mechanics liens.\\n— Judah Duke\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'Voucher recipients across Illinois are struggling to find housing as challenges in subsidized housing programs grow, the Chicago Tribune\\nreported\\n.\\nMost subsidies come through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Housing Choice Voucher Program, which allows recipients to pay about 30 percent of their income toward rent while local housing authorities cover the rest.\\nYet many recipients are unable to lease units due to hurdles including landlords\\nrefusing to accept vouchers\\n, often due to discrimination, and a lack of inventory.\\nThe Chicago Housing Authority’s lease-up rates fell to 31 percent last year, down from 45 percent in 2023. The figure ranged from 61 percent to 77 percent between 2019 and 2022.\\nSimilarly, the North Chicago Housing Authority reported a 50 percent lease-up rate last year, while the Lake County Housing Authority logged 62 percent. Some recipients are still searching for homes, meaning these rates could shift.\\nThe struggle to find housing can be grueling for voucher holders, who may have to sleep in their cars or couch surf, shower at the gym and store personal items at work. Once they are approved for vouchers, the clock is ticking, and time can run out before they find housing.\\n\\nSome housing authorities are adopting strategies to address the problems. Housing authorities in Waukegan, North Chicago and Lake County last year agreed to allow voucher holders to lease units in any of their jurisdictions, aiming to expand options and increase lease-up rates.\\nWaukegan and Lake County have also received HUD approval to offer monetary incentives to landlords.\\nMeanwhile, landlords cite barriers like bureaucratic delays, inspections and a lack of standardization across housing authorities. Some housing providers have called for streamlining the process through faster unit approvals and more consistent administrative standards.\\nNationally, about 60 percent of voucher holders are able to lease units, according to New York University’s Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy.\\nThe rates are lower in markets with older housing stock and among recipients of color — two conditions that especially apply in Chicago.\\n— Judah Duke\\n',\n",

They did not immediately reply to a request for comment via a spokesperson.\\nA Transwestern marketing page for the property indicates that the recently snagged LangChain space is Suite 120, which is located directly off the lobby and has two large conference rooms, five smaller huddle rooms, a private shower, an open kitchen/dining area and 16-foot-high ceilings. The unitQ space appears to be Suite 212, which has 10 conference rooms and an open kitchen. A Swig representative would not confirm the suite numbers.\\nThere are still seven vacant suites in the building totaling about 50,000 square feet, according to the site, which also shows three of those have been undergoing spec suite renovations. They will be delivered in April, Swig confirmed.\\n\\nBlake Walker and Caroline O’Loughlin Livermore of CBRE represented LangChain. Walker said LangChain would be moving into a furnished space, which “minimized disruption” so they could focus on their business and give their team “an office they enjoy coming into.”\\n“The decision to move to 501 Second Street was driven by favorable economics, term flexibility, and a high-quality workspace that supports their growing team,” he said.\\nWill Cassriel and Grant Dettmer of JLL represented unitQ. They did not immediately reply to a request for comment via a representative.\\nAI has been touted as the likely taker for a substantial portion of San Francisco’s one-third-empty office space. There were\\n86 AI leases signed last year\\nin the city, according to Kilroy analysis, with AI expected to drive another 1 million to 1.5 million square feet in absorption this year. Tech office leasing was up 17 percent last year,\\ndriven by AI\\ndemand, according to CBRE.\\nAI companies are “absolutely” having an impact on the office market, Walker said, adding that with 5 million square feet of leased space, the city’s 200 AI companies represent nearly 9% of the total occupied office space in the city.\\n“These AI companies recognize the strategic value of being in San Francisco—not just for access to talent and investors, but for building in-office cultures that will help shape the future of downtown,” he said.\\nIf more of these AI companies come to SoMa, it would be a much-needed boost to the neighborhood, which has been\\nhit harder than other SF markets\\nby tech’s office retreat since the pandemic. At the end of 2024, SoMa was 40 percent vacant, compared to 36.5 percent citywide, according to CBRE data.\\n',\n",

So she bought it in 2023 for an undisclosed price.\\nPlans now call for preserving the memorial and half the property as open space, while building a subdivision of 15 single-family homes around a “village green,” with an outdoor cooking and dining area, according to the Chronicle.\\nFive of the homes would have accessory dwelling units, or granny flats. The development would climb up the slope along Oak Hill Road, below a ridgeline of preserved open space.\\n\\nDutto has employed a state density bonus and Senate Bill 330 for streamlined approvals. On Monday, the Lafayette Planning Commission was slated to hold an informational hearing.\\nThe application came as housing advocates\\nsued the East Bay city\\nfor creating “misleading and unrealistic housing sites” to satisfy state-mandated housing goals.\\nThe lawsuit by the Housing Action Coalition accused Lafayette of “pretending” to comply with the state housing element, a planning blueprint required of every city and county across the state every eight years.\\nMayor Susan Candell took issue with the lawsuit, according to the Chronicle, saying the City Council has approved all housing projects that have come before it. She said the city will have no choice but to approve the Deer Hill Road project.\\nLafayette, a wealthy city with $2 million homes, was once a battleground for the region’s housing wars, with two lawsuits, a ballot referendum and more than 100 public hearings that delayed a 315-unit apartment building for almost a dozen years.\\nWithin a 10-year span, 115 homes were built in the city of 25,000 residents, including 10 in 2010, 76 in 2018 and 29 in 2019. The city must rezone to build 2,114 homes, 943 of them affordable, by 2031.\\nLast year, the\\nstate Supreme Court declined\\nto hear an appeal from a neighborhood group, allowing the development to move forward.

They did not immediately reply to a request for comment via a spokesperson.\\nA Transwestern marketing page for the property indicates that the recently snagged LangChain space is Suite 120, which is located directly off the lobby and has two large conference rooms, five smaller huddle rooms, a private shower, an open kitchen/dining area and 16-foot-high ceilings. The unitQ space appears to be Suite 212, which has 10 conference rooms and an open kitchen. A Swig representative would not confirm the suite numbers.\\nThere are still seven vacant suites in the building totaling about 50,000 square feet, according to the site, which also shows three of those have been undergoing spec suite renovations. They will be delivered in April, Swig confirmed.\\n\\nBlake Walker and Caroline O’Loughlin Livermore of CBRE represented LangChain. Walker said LangChain would be moving into a furnished space, which “minimized disruption” so they could focus on their business and give their team “an office they enjoy coming into.”\\n“The decision to move to 501 Second Street was driven by favorable economics, term flexibility, and a high-quality workspace that supports their growing team,” he said.\\nWill Cassriel and Grant Dettmer of JLL represented unitQ. They did not immediately reply to a request for comment via a representative.\\nAI has been touted as the likely taker for a substantial portion of San Francisco’s one-third-empty office space. There were\\n86 AI leases signed last year\\nin the city, according to Kilroy analysis, with AI expected to drive another 1 million to 1.5 million square feet in absorption this year. Tech office leasing was up 17 percent last year,\\ndriven by AI\\ndemand, according to CBRE.\\nAI companies are “absolutely” having an impact on the office market, Walker said, adding that with 5 million square feet of leased space, the city’s 200 AI companies represent nearly 9% of the total occupied office space in the city.\\n“These AI companies recognize the strategic value of being in San Francisco—not just for access to talent and investors, but for building in-office cultures that will help shape the future of downtown,” he said.\\nIf more of these AI companies come to SoMa, it would be a much-needed boost to the neighborhood, which has been\\nhit harder than other SF markets\\nby tech’s office retreat since the pandemic. At the end of 2024, SoMa was 40 percent vacant, compared to 36.5 percent citywide, according to CBRE data.\\n',\n",

So she bought it in 2023 for an undisclosed price.\\nPlans now call for preserving the memorial and half the property as open space, while building a subdivision of 15 single-family homes around a “village green,” with an outdoor cooking and dining area, according to the Chronicle.\\nFive of the homes would have accessory dwelling units, or granny flats. The development would climb up the slope along Oak Hill Road, below a ridgeline of preserved open space.\\n\\nDutto has employed a state density bonus and Senate Bill 330 for streamlined approvals. On Monday, the Lafayette Planning Commission was slated to hold an informational hearing.\\nThe application came as housing advocates\\nsued the East Bay city\\nfor creating “misleading and unrealistic housing sites” to satisfy state-mandated housing goals.\\nThe lawsuit by the Housing Action Coalition accused Lafayette of “pretending” to comply with the state housing element, a planning blueprint required of every city and county across the state every eight years.\\nMayor Susan Candell took issue with the lawsuit, according to the Chronicle, saying the City Council has approved all housing projects that have come before it. She said the city will have no choice but to approve the Deer Hill Road project.\\nLafayette, a wealthy city with $2 million homes, was once a battleground for the region’s housing wars, with two lawsuits, a ballot referendum and more than 100 public hearings that delayed a 315-unit apartment building for almost a dozen years.\\nWithin a 10-year span, 115 homes were built in the city of 25,000 residents, including 10 in 2010, 76 in 2018 and 29 in 2019. The city must rezone to build 2,114 homes, 943 of them affordable, by 2031.\\nLast year, the\\nstate Supreme Court declined\\nto hear an appeal from a neighborhood group, allowing the development to move forward. The project has not broken ground.\\n—\\nDana Bartholomew\\n',\n",

A previous 19-story hotel and fitness club project, approved in 2021, stalled.\\n“This started out as a contrarian bet but as we dug in deeper and looked at the market, how it is evolving and maturing out of Covid, it doesn’t seem so contrarian any more,” Gino Canori, president of Related California, told the San Francisco Chronicle.\\nRelated hopes to secure approvals to build the tower this fall, allowing the firm to break ground by late next year. If all goes well, it could be completed by 2030.\\nMichelin-starred chef, Ralph Lauren come to Jackson Square\\nRestaurateur Peter Hemsley of Michelin-starred Aphotic\\njoined forces\\nwith developer Brick &amp; Timber, which keeps its headquarters in the neighborhood, to buy a 15,600-square-foot store and building at 530 Jackson Street for $32.4 million, or over $2,000 a square foot.\\n\\nHemsley announced last year he would shut Aphotic, blaming the SoMa location. It’s not clear whether the chef intends to revive the sustainable seafood restaurant or launch a new concept in the ground-floor space that was home to Kells Irish Restaurant and Pub for decades. Paul McAleese is the owner of Kells Irish Restaurant and Bar as well as the seller of 530 Jackson.\\nJust down the street from 530 Jackson, Ralph Lauren opened its first new store in the city in years.\\n“The opening of Polo Ralph Lauren in Jackson Square is a testament to the neighborhood’s growing appeal as a premier destination for retail,” Robbie Silver, CEO of the Downtown SF Partnership, said in a statement.\\nSweetgreen, Blue Bottle sign long-term Mission Rock leases\\nIn further retail news, Mission Rock developers Tishman Speyer and the San Francisco Giants announced\\ntwo new long-term deals\\nat their Mission Bay development. Blue Bottle Coffee and Sweetgreen have signed 10-year leases at Mission Rock and Arsicault bakery finally opened its doors in the development.\\nOakland-founded Blue Bottle will occupy 2,069 square feet at the base of the building occupied by Visa at 300 Toni Stone Crossing. Salad-and-grain bowl shop Sweetgreen will take just under 2,400 square feet at the base of The Canyon, a residential tower at the intersection of Dr. Maya Angelou Lane and Toni Strone Crossing.\\nAlex Sagues and Madeline Mandanis represented the landlords in the deal. Sagues called Mission Bay “the most vibrant neighborhood in San Francisco”. He said retailers are drawn to the transit-friendly area because “it is a true seven-day neighborhood,” with office, life sciences, residential, and the UCSF hospital, as well as events at Chase Center and Oracle Park.\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'State insurance regulators have unveiled a new plan to stabilize the home insurance market by pushing insurers to expand coverage in fire-prone areas where companies have dropped hundreds of thousands of homeowners in recent years.\\nThe plan updates a map of high-risk zip codes where insurers will be required to write more policies, aiming to create a more equitable insurance market despite growing wildfire threats, the\\nSan Jose Mercury News reported\\n.\\nHowever, many high-risk Bay Area neighborhoods, including Oakland, the Berkeley Hills and Gilroy, aren’t included in the updated map.\\nState regulators say this is because those areas fall within zip codes where the overall insurance need is deemed lower. Despite this, new rules will still require insurers to offer coverage to homeowners in these areas who have been rejected by traditional providers due to fire risk.\\n“Insurance companies have ignored those homes, and we’re trying to put the spotlight on them,” Michael Soller, spokesperson for the California Department of Insurance, told the Mercury News.\\nThe plan stems from a deal with the insurance industry, allowing companies to raise rates based on climate-related risks in exchange for expanding coverage in high-risk areas.\\nCalifornians currently pay an average of $1,435 annually for homeowners insurance, below the national average. But prices vary widely. And insurers like State Farm and Allstate have stopped issuing new policies in the state, citing strict rate-setting rules and wildfire losses.\\nThe new rules require insurers to cover a proportional share of high-risk policies. For example, if a company covers 100 of every 1,000 policies statewide, it must cover 85 of every 1,000 in high-risk areas.\\n\\nHowever, some consumer groups argue the reforms have loopholes that may allow insurers to delay meeting these targets or only slightly increase coverage.\\nHomeowners in fire-prone areas, like Carolyn Grote of the Berkeley Hills, are preparing independently. Grote formed a “Firewise community” with neighbors to improve fire safety, hoping to retain her insurance.\\n“If Firewise could help people retain their insurance, that might be the biggest motivator,” she told the newspaper.\\nConsumer groups are skeptical.\\n“Insurers can use secret models to raise rates right away with unenforceable promises to expand coverage,” Carmen Balber of nonprofit Consumer Watchdog told the Mercury News.\\nRegulators, however, insist they will monitor compliance closely and can revoke rate-setting privileges if insurers fail to meet coverage requirements.\\n—\\nDana Bartholomew\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'SAJ Development wants to swing a wrecking ball into three office buildings in Lafayette to erect a 90-unit apartment building in an upscale city long opposed to affordable housing.\\nThe locally based developer filed revised plans to replace the offices with a seven-story, 171,400-square-foot complex at 1001 Oak Hill Road,\\nthe San Francisco Business Times reported\\n. The city will consider the project on March 17.\\nThe application came as housing advocates\\nsued the East Bay city\\nfor creating “misleading and unrealistic housing sites” to satisfy state-mandated housing goals. The lawsuit by the Housing Action Coalition accused Lafayette of “pretending” to comply with the state housing element, a planning blueprint required of every city and county across the state every eight years.\\nLafayette’s alleged shell game includes relying on faith-based institutions and longtime businesses with no plans to develop housing as potential building sites for homes, according to the complaint.\\nThe lawsuit seeks a court to compel the city to adopt a revised plan with an update to its zoning laws. The city must rezone to build 2,114 homes, 943 of them affordable, by 2031. Within the decade through 2019, the city permitted 115 homes.\\nSAJ could help remedy that by its mixed-use project calling for 79 market-rate apartments and 11 affordable apartments, including five for very-low-income households and six for moderate-income households.\\nWhat appears to be a U-shaped complex, designed by Berkeley-based Trachtenberg Architects, would be draped in two shades of brown, with tiered roof decks, and floor-to-ceiling corner windows with exterior balconies, according to a rendering.\\nThe developer would employ a nearly 23 percent state density bonus in exchange for the affordable housing, plus a state streamlining law for faster approvals. A cost and timeline for construction were not disclosed.\\n\\nSAJ applied using Senate Bill 330, which effectively freezes zoning that’s in place at the time a project is submitted, limits the number of public hearings to five and suspends or eliminates restrictions on housing development.\\nThe law aims to prevent cities from delaying projects unnecessarily over subjective standards, along with several other laws meant to stop cities from blocking affordable housing.\\nThe developer had submitted an earlier version of the project in 2022 that called for tearing down just two of the three offices to build\\n53 units\\n. City officials approved that version in May, before SAJ revised its plans. Jeff Stone, owner of Diamond Construction, was listed as the property owner operating through SAJ Development, according to SFYimby.\\nLafayette was once a battleground for the region’s housing wars, with two lawsuits, a ballot referendum and more than 100 public hearings that delayed a 315-unit apartment building for almost a dozen years.\\nLast year, the\\nstate Supreme Court declined\\nto hear an appeal from a neighborhood group, allowing the development to move forward. The project has not broken ground.\\nMembership in SAJ Development, led by Stone, includes Diamond Swope Holdings, the Steven Kay Trust, the Griggs Community Property Trust and Outdo, based in Lafayette, according to state business records. Another firm, Valley Oak Capital, is based in Texas.\\n—\\nDana Bartholomew\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'San Francisco officials have delayed suspending a voter-approved “Empty Homes Tax” during a legal challenge because of a push by Supervisor Jackie Fielder to keep the measure alive.\\nThe tax, known as Proposition M, was approved in November 2022 with 54 percent of the vote and targets property owners with residential units left vacant for over 182 days a year,\\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported.\\nTaxes range from $2,500 to $5,000 based on size, rising to a maximum of $20,000 a year per unit, applying only to buildings with three or more apartments.\\nFielder argued that amendments should be explored to prevent the tax from being suspended indefinitely while the city fights a lawsuit from landlords and property owners who say it violates their property rights.\\nShe proposed that the tax suspension should only last “until the courts tell us otherwise,” allowing the city to collect if legally permitted. Fielder’s motion to continue the vote passed unanimously, with a hearing set for March 18.\\nThe Empty Homes Tax took effect at the beginning of last year, with collections planned for upcoming April.\\n\\nProponents estimated it would generate more than $20 million a year for housing and unlock about 5,000 units within two years, though critics have questioned the projections.\\nThe tax has faced legal challenges since February 2023, when property owner groups filed a lawsuit alleging it was coercive and infringed on their rights.\\nIn December 2023, Superior Court Judge Charles Haines\\ndeclined to dismiss the lawsuit\\narguing in a ruling that property owners don’t need to wait until the tax is due to challenge it in court. In October, Haines\\nstruck down the tax\\n, saying that it violated the U.S. and California constitutions and was preempted by California law.\\nThe court subsequently ordered the city to halt enforcement and collection, and the city treasurer stated that property owners would not be required to pay by the original April 30, 2025 deadline unless the court’s decision is reversed on appeal.\\nThe city attorney’s office is now appealing the ruling and has expressed disappointment with the trial court’s decision.\\n—\\nDana Bartholomew\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'A proposed legal settlement over the botched environmental cleanup of Hunters Point Shipyard would leave thousands of affected residents with just $606 per person.\\nA federal judge denied the agreement between developers FivePoint Holdings and Lennar and lawyers behind the $1 billion lawsuit — calling it a “sweetheart deal” for the builders and the “worst settlement” he’s ever seen, the\\nSan Francisco Chronicle reported.\\nIn a scathing order, U.S. District Judge James Donato called the proposed payout to 6,500 residents of Hunters Point “paltry,” and accused the plaintiff’s lawyers of selling out their clients.\\n“No question that the proposed terms are unfair to the class members,” he said during a January hearing.\\nResidents of Hunters Point filed a lawsuit in 2018 alleging they were the victims of fraud and had suffered health defects in connection with the former shipyard’s ongoing toxic cleanup.\\nIn the latest attempt by Irvine-based FivePoint and Miami-based Lennar to settle, the developers and Sausalito law firm Bonner &amp; Bonner had asked the court to approve a $5.4 million deal.\\nBut with $1.4 million for attorney fees and $4 million in community payouts, it worked out to $606 per person. A settlement proposal in 2022 for 9,000 residents, also rejected by the judge, would have worked out to $400 per person.\\nDonato accused the residents’ attorneys, Charles and Cabral Bonner, of colluding against Tetra Tech EC, a third defendant in the lawsuit but left out of the settlement talks. The unit of Tetra Tech was hired two decades ago to\\nclean hazardous radiation and toxic substances\\nfrom the shipyard once owned by the U.S. Navy.\\nThe developers and the Bonners had entered into a “common interest agreement,” which allows parties with shared legal interests to share information in order to collaborate on defense strategies. But the judge said the residents and developers are “adverse parties” who cut a deal to target Tetra Tech EC.\\nSuch a settlement “becomes collusive when it is aimed to injure the interests” of an absent defendant, Donato said.\\n\\nThe Bonners have denied wrongdoing, saying they acted in the best interest of their clients by collaborating with the developers. Lennar declined to comment to the Chronicle, while FivePoint didn’t respond to a request for comment.\\nSam Singer, a spokesperson for Pasadena-based Tetra Tech EC said: “The judge’s order speaks for itself.”\\nAfter signing the common interest agreement, the Bonners amended the residents’ complaint for the sixth time. The changes “drastically narrowed plaintiff’s claims against the home builder defendants, dropped the class allegations against them, and deleted the damages demand of $1 billion,” Donato wrote in his order.\\n“The evidence of collusion is striking,” Donato wrote. During the hearing, he questioned why the developers should be allowed to exit a $1 billion lawsuit in exchange for “paying nickels.”\\nFivePoint, a spinoff of Lennar, has entitlements for thousands of homes and millions of square feet of commercial space at Hunter’s Point.\\nA trial date for the case is set for next year, but the Bonners said they are talking with the developers about another settlement deal, and\\nreached out to Tetra Tech EC\\nto “see if they are interested in negotiating.”\\nTetra Tech EC has faced\\nmultiple ongoing lawsuits\\nrelated to the cleanup of the 500-acre shipyard site, including a lawsuit filed by the developers in 2020. This year, the U.S. Department of Justice agreed to settle a lawsuit brought against the contractor a decade ago, originally by whistleblowers, for\\n$97 million\\n, according to the Chronicle.\\nThe Navy previously said in other court filings that the “negative fiscal impact” of the fraud at the shipyard is between\\n$370 million and $570 million\\n.\\n—\\nDana Bartholomew\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'When Tony Prophet joined Salesforce as its chief equality officer in 2016, he wanted the “real urban experience of living in San Francisco,” which he didn’t associate with the city’s\\ntraditional high-end neighborhoods\\non the north side of town. Instead he went into\\nSoMa\\n, “eyes wide open,” buying a 7,000-square-foot top-floor condo at 9 Bernice Street for just over $7 million in November 2016.\\n“No surprises,” he said of his time living with his then-wife and their son at the semi-industrial location near Rainbow Grocery and the DNA Lounge. “We knew everything—all the good and the challenges that we were in for—and saw some real improvements along the way.”\\nNearly a decade later and with more than $1 million poured into creating a wind-shielded roof deck with astroturf and a fire pit, Prophet is hoping his condo will break West SOMA residential records, with an asking price of $8.8 million.\\nA price of about $1,250 per square foot is not out of step for the neighborhood. But because there are not many condos or even single-family homes as big as 9 Bernice, there are seldom sales above $5 million. So while it’s “impossible to replicate what’s been done here,” according to Compass agent Butch Haze, who is listing the skylit two-level loft with three bedrooms, 3.5 baths, a wine room, and a glass-enclosed gym, it’s also nearly impossible to find comps.\\n“You really have to compare it to buying a warehouse and what it would take to do the TIs,” he said, adding that the turnkey aspect is “baked in” to the asking price.\\nThere are added perks as well. The condo includes the elaborate light fixtures and large-scale furniture, almost entirely from Restoration Hardware, including a 16-seat dining table that was craned in by the previous owner, luxury retailer Wilkes-Bashford co-owner Tyler Mitchell.\\n\\n“Not everyone loves Restoration Hardware, but nobody hates it,” said Prophet, who built on interior designer Ken Fulk’s work for Mitchell.\\nThe new price marks a big drop from the last time the condo was on the market in 2022, when it was listed at just under $11 million. The home didn’t find a buyer at the time, but Prophet had already moved to Florida so his son could attend IMG, a sports academy about an hour south of Tampa. For the last two years, he has rented it to a foursome of entrepreneurs from the start up world. Haze said the new price had to speak to today’s “value-driven buyer.”\\n“We wanted to price it where the price per square foot is just too attractive,” Haze said.\\nThere are a lot of early stage businesses walking distance from the property, Prophet added, which borders the Mission, Potero Hill and the Design District. The “perfect fit” would be someone who is excited by the idea of walking to work and entertaining in the enormous space, he said.\\nProphet said he hosted everything from fundraisers for London Breed and the Women’s HIV Program at UCSF to media events for Salesforce during his time there. He left Salesforce in 2021, and now sits on the board at Dolby Labs and is an investor and board member for an AI-assisted sales platform called Aviso.\\nThe likely buyer for this home probably also sits on a lot of boards, Haze said, and is in their 50s or 60s but still active in tech or finance. They probably already own more traditional homes outside the city, but are looking for something different. It may be somebody that has “flirted with” the north side of the city or Noe Valley, but can’t pass up the outside-the-box offering.\\n“They want to have fun in a really cool, almost superhero lair in San Francisco that wows all their friends,” he said.\\nThat’s a very specific buyer profile, but Prophet said he can be patient until the right person comes along.\\n“It’s super special for someone who sees that opportunity,” he said. “It was the same situation when we bought it: a unique property and a high price point.”\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'Two major San Francisco apartment building trades by longtime owners have closed in the first few months of the year, including the $35 million sale of the block-long Normandy Apartments, just behind the famed St. Mary’s Cathedral.\\nThe early spring sales are further signs of\\nnew life in the market\\nthat agents saw beginning in the latter half of last year.\\nThe seller of the 1968-built 108-unit complex at 1135-1175 Ellis Street was a partnership called Normandy Apartments that goes back to at least the 1990s, according to city records. The buyer was affordable housing developer Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation, which bought the property with funding from the San Francisco Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development and is planning a major renovation. The MOHCD confirmed the $35 million price.\\nThe Jan. 31 acquisition will create “permanently affordable units in the City’s Western Addition neighborhood for families, individuals, couples, older adults, and long-term residents within a variety of ethnic and racial backgrounds,” according to a TNDC announcement. With the exception of one manager’s unit, all apartments will be restricted to households not to exceed 120 percent of the city’s area median income with an average of 80 percent of the city’s AMI. In 2024, 80 percent of AMI would mean that a single person making up to $83,900 would be eligible, for example, while a household with three people could make up to $107,900, according to the MOHCD website.\\nA November 2024 MOHCD memo about TNDC’s request for just over $52 million in permanent financing for the purchase and rehabilitation of the nearly 70,000-square-foot property said the building is in “good condition” and 90 percent occupied. The planned rehabilitation will focus on fire and life safety upgrades and accessibility and ADA upgrades and requirements.\\nColliers agent Brad Lagomarsino represented the sellers and said that TNDC and MOHCD “seized the rare opportunity to purchase 108 units in the heart of San Francisco”. He added that the nearly 1.5-acre lot\\xa0 “offers tremendous development potential that justifies the price paid for the asset.”\\n\\nIn another early spring sale after a decades-long hold, a 36-unit Nob Hill apartment building traded for the first time since it was built in 1954, according to public records. The price was $14.5 million, or just over $400,000 per unit, according to the transfer tax on the sale. That’s above the average of about $340,000 per unit in San Francisco in 2024, according to Colliers data.\\nColliers listing agent Dustin Dolby said he could not comment on the Feb. 18 sale due to a non-disclosure agreement, but he posted on LinkedIn that, “With its proximity to Grace Cathedral, Huntington Park, and the Financial District, 1330 Jones exemplifies the enduring desirability of Nob Hill real estate.”\\nThe sellers were the descendants of the developer, Theo G. Meyer and Sons, which built the seven-story building, according to the deed and probate records. The buyer was Otrera Real Estate, LLC, a Delaware-created entity that lists its address as a P.O. Box at the Rincon Finance Center in downtown San Francisco, according to the deed. The buyers’ agent is unknown.\\nThe six-story building at 1330 Jones has 18 one-bedroom, one-bath units, six two-bedroom, one-bath units, and 12 two-bedroom, two-bath units, as well as 23 dedicated parking spots and onsite laundry.\\nThe building was first listed as part of a\\nthree-building portfolio\\nthat was all developed by the Meyer family and came to market at an undisclosed price last summer. It is the smallest building of the three, and the only one to sell thus far. The other two buildings are a 62-unit, 13-story building at 1000 Green Street in Russian Hill and the 56-unit, 13-story Crest Royal at 1310 Jones, which is next door to the building that sold.\\nAt least two other San Francisco apartment buildings asking over $10 million are also in contract but are still pending. Magnolia Place, which has 27 apartment units at 3322 Buchanan in the Marina, came to market at the end of September with an asking price of $18 million. The 2001-built non-rent-controlled building with two commercial units fronting Lombard Street has been pending as of Nov. 22, according to Redfin.\\xa0At 1745 Market, a property with 48 apartment units and eight commercial spaces, including local favorite piano bar Martuni’s, went into contract on Jan. 27, according to Redfin. It is owned by\\nMosser Properties\\nand has been\\non and off the market for the last few years\\n, with a starting price of $25 million in 2022. It came back to market most recently last September, with an asking price of $14 million. That ask dropped to $13 million in November, just $1 million more than Mosser paid for it back in 2017.\\n',\n",

The other two are at 4208 Armstrong Parkway and 4209 Bordeaux Avenue.\\nThe couple’s plans for their 2.5 acres of prime properties are a mystery. They haven’t commented, but it’s led to questions about whether the unique home, and the historic residences next to it, will survive or be cleared to make way for new construction.\\nThe Cooleys haven’t filed any demolition or major renovation permits, though plumbing and mechanical permits were submitted for two of the properties. Preservationists are hopeful that at least the 1920s Tudor-style home on Bordeaux, designed by famed architect Hal Thomson, will be spared.\\nThe group Preservation Park Cities recently toured two of the homes but wasn’t allowed inside 4208 Armstrong Parkway due to structural concerns.\\nClay Cooley attended a Preservation Park Cities meeting in February, where he expressed a desire to avoid community conflict. Preservationists suggested a design that would retain the Bordeaux home as a guesthouse while allowing for a new build on the Armstrong lots.\\n\\nThe couple bought the home at 4208 Armstrong Parkway first, in 2020, county records show. They then purchased 4209 Bordeaux Avenue and the Mushroom House in a five-month period, transferring them into their name by December 2024.\\nThe Mushroom House, completed in 1997 by Dallas architect Tom Workman, has long divided opinion for its whimsical, storybook-like design. Its price history is unavailable, but its market value is estimated at over $7.5 million, according to Zillow.\\nPreservationists admit that while the house is architecturally significant, it may be less defensible due to its modern construction and location on a highly visible lot.\\nLocal ordinances also complicate the equation. Highland Park rules prohibit combining all three parcels into a single lot, which could influence Cooley’s final decision.\\n— Judah Duke\\n',\n",

The closure threatens to leave a major void in the city’s retail core, as Neiman Marcus also plans to vacate its 82,000-square-foot headquarters at Cityplace Tower.\\nWhile Dallas officials hold out hope for a deal, Saks is already moving forward with plans to invest $100 million into its Neiman Marcus location at NorthPark Center, suggesting its focus is shifting away from downtown.\\n— Judah Duke\\n',\n",

The other two are at 4208 Armstrong Parkway and 4209 Bordeaux Avenue.\\nThe couple’s plans for their 2.5 acres of prime properties are a mystery. They haven’t commented, but it’s led to questions about whether the unique home, and the historic residences next to it, will survive or be cleared to make way for new construction.\\nThe Cooleys haven’t filed any demolition or major renovation permits, though plumbing and mechanical permits were submitted for two of the properties. Preservationists are hopeful that at least the 1920s Tudor-style home on Bordeaux, designed by famed architect Hal Thomson, will be spared.\\nThe group Preservation Park Cities recently toured two of the homes but wasn’t allowed inside 4208 Armstrong Parkway due to structural concerns.\\nClay Cooley attended a Preservation Park Cities meeting in February, where he expressed a desire to avoid community conflict. Preservationists suggested a design that would retain the Bordeaux home as a guesthouse while allowing for a new build on the Armstrong lots.\\n\\nThe couple bought the home at 4208 Armstrong Parkway first, in 2020, county records show. They then purchased 4209 Bordeaux Avenue and the Mushroom House in a five-month period, transferring them into their name by December 2024.\\nThe Mushroom House, completed in 1997 by Dallas architect Tom Workman, has long divided opinion for its whimsical, storybook-like design. Its price history is unavailable, but its market value is estimated at over $7.5 million, according to Zillow.\\nPreservationists admit that while the house is architecturally significant, it may be less defensible due to its modern construction and location on a highly visible lot.\\nLocal ordinances also complicate the equation. Highland Park rules prohibit combining all three parcels into a single lot, which could influence Cooley’s final decision.\\n— Judah Duke\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'Houston’s largest landowners include homebuilders carving out new suburbs and public entities managing flood zones and parks.\\nThe top 10 landowners control about 2.6 percent of the metro, the Houston Chronicle\\nreported\\n.\\nThe ranking was compiled based on an analysis of Harris, Montgomery, Liberty, Fort Bend, Brazoria, Galveston and Chambers counties, calculating acreage totals from public property records and mapping data and ranking by parcel totals.\\nIt offers a snapshot of the region’s most influential landholders shaping development patterns in and around the Houston metro.\\nPrivate developers dominate the landscape, with Camillo Companies leading the pack.\\nThe Houston-based homebuilder owns 3,650 acres across six counties, supporting the development of 11,222 residential lots under its brands, including SimplyHome and Legend Homes.\\nAnother major player, Arlington-based D.R. Horton, holds 3,490 acres. As Houston’s most active homebuilder in 2023, it led the region with 5,570 home starts and continues expanding in suburban communities.\\nMeanwhile, Colony Ridge controls nearly 15,000 acres, primarily in Liberty County. The firm, known for developing infrastructure-ready lots, remains a major driver of suburban sprawl despite facing\\nscrutiny over its business practices\\n.\\n\\nPublic entities are also prominent landholders. The City of Houston manages 31,530 acres, including major public assets like George Bush Intercontinental Airport, parklands and municipal facilities. The Harris County Flood Control District controls 26,000 acres for its role in flood mitigation efforts.\\nThe role of public entities in flood mitigation is particularly crucial, the Bayou City’s low-lying topography and history of major flooding events making infrastructure and water management far more important to long-term development planning relative to most other Texas metros.\\nHarris County itself holds 30,130 acres, spanning government buildings, recreational spaces and major event venues like NRG Park.\\nHouston’s sprawl is driven by a mix of public investment and private development, with much of the metro’s expansion occurring along major growth corridors like Interstate 45, U.S. Highway 59 and the Grand Parkway.\\nLiberty County, where Colony Ridge dominates, is one of the fastest-growing exurban areas, driven by demand for affordable housing. Its population increased 25.5 percent from mid-2020 to last summer, Census data shows.\\nMeanwhile, Fort Bend and Montgomery counties continue to attract large-scale master-planned communities, fueled by population growth and proximity to Houston’s employment centers.\\n— Judah Duke\\n',\n",

Sands acquired 259 acres near the former Texas Stadium in mid-2023.\\nThe changes would pave the way for a destination resort featuring a potential casino — pending state legalization — as well as a 15,000-seat arena for the Dallas Mavericks, plus a hotel, retail and entertainment spaces.\\nThe debate comes amid broader speculation about the future of the Dallas Mavericks, co-owned by Sands’\\nnewly promoted CEO Patrick Dumont\\n. Sands bought Mark Cuban’s majority stake in the Mavericks for $3.5 billion at the end of 2023.\\n\\nThe rezoning would also establish a baseline development framework, though Sands would need to submit detailed plans for approval later. The proposal is still moving through the early stages. The commission scheduled to revisit it on Monday before a possible city council vote next Thursday.\\nResidents argued that discussions were being rushed and lacked transparency, with some claiming they first learned of the zoning amendments just 48 hours before the meeting. Others questioned why city leaders would consider approving zoning for a casino while gambling is illegal in Texas.\\nSands has said that a casino is essential for the project’s financial viability. Casino revenue is necessary to support other resort amenities like convention space and entertainment venues, the company said.\\nThe company plans to have representatives at the upcoming meetings and maintained Sands is committed to “ongoing engagement and collaboration,” spokesman Ron Reese said.\\nRemoving casino gaming from the zoning could force Sands to reconsider the development altogether, he said.\\n— Judah Duke\\n',\n",

Meta occupies Third + Shoal, at 607 West 3rd Street, about four blocks away, as the anchor tenant.\\n\\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg\\nadjusted\\nthe company’s remote work policy in 2023, calling more employees back to work, with most required to come to the office at least three days a week, but few adjustments to Meta’s Austin real estate plans have been made.\\nMeta’s effort to reconfigure or backfill office space mirrors broader trends in Austin, where high-profile tech tenants like Google are also facing questions about long-term office plans. Google still hasn’t occupied the 804,000-square-foot\\nSail Tower\\n, at 601 West 2nd Street, which it leased in 2019.\\nIBM\\ndid the opposite\\nin September, agreeing to assume Meta’s lease for the 320,000-square-foot Domain 12 building in North Austin, with plans to take occupancy in January 2026 and extend the lease through 2040.\\nAustin’s office vacancy rate hit an all-time high of 22.5 percent in the fourth quarter 2024, according to Colliers. It has the second-biggest office pipeline for this year, behind Boston, with 3.6 million square feet of space under development set to boost office stock by 4 percent, according to\\nCommercialCafe\\n.\\n— Judah Duke\\n',\n",

       "  'content': 'A law firm lease will bring Hines’ Texas Tower to 99 percent leased.\\nSkadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom leased 52,000 square feet spanning two full floors at 845 Texas Avenue, the Houston Business Journal\\nreported\\n. The lease will begin in April 2026, but the terms weren’t otherwise disclosed.\\nThe deal leaves just 18,000 square feet available in the 47-story, 1.2 million-square-foot tower, which is co-owned by Houston-based Hines and Ivanhoe Cambridge. Savills’ Mark O’Donnell represented the tenant, and Michael Anderson of Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented the landlords.\\nThe lease follows Hines’\\nlanding a rare $450 million refinancing\\nearlier this month, marking the first time in two years a multi-tenant office tower outside New York City was financed through the CMBS single-asset, single-borrower market.\\nSkadden will move from its 24,000-square-foot space at 1000 Louisiana Street, Wells Fargo Plaza.\\nThat 71-story tower was built in 1983. Its owner, MetLife, plans to spend $138,000 to remodel its 900-square-foot\\namenity space\\nfor an arcade game room to lure tenants after adding a golf simulator last year. It is also adding a restaurant, bar and tenant lounge, according to the building’s website.\\nTexas Tower opened in 2021 and is among the city’s most leased Class A office towers. Other tenants, with Hines’ global headquarters, include law firms Vinson &amp; Elkins, Clifford Chance and DLA Piper as well as Cheniere Energy, Morgan Stanley and coworking space The Square.\\n\\nThe tower includes two restaurants managed by Berg Hospitality Group. The Sylvie, a French bistro, opened last year. Seafood restaurant Dune Road was set to open last year but hasn’t yet delivered.\\nIt also features amenities like underfloor air conditioning, private terraces and a 9,600-square-foot amenity center with a lounge and conference space.\\nThe tower’s leasing success highlights the “flight-to-quality” trend, Hines senior managing director John Mooz said.\\nClass A inventory has tightened in the city as tenants opt to lease where amenities are enticing enough to lure and retain workers. Older buildings have suffered as a result. The office vacancy rate remains high; it was up to 25.7 percent in the fourth quarter, according to CoStar.\\nHouston’s office pipeline has 1.9 million square feet of space under development, about tied with Los Angeles as of January, according to data from CommercialEdge cited by\\nCommercialCafe\\n. Dallas has 2.8 million square feet underway, and Austin has 3.6 million, the second-most in the nation behind Boston.\\nThe drop in office output from previous years across southern markets will likely have a positive effect on occupancy rates, especially as more employers initiate return-to-office mandates, the site said.\\n— Judah Duke\\n',\n",
