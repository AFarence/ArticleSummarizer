    "content": "Hoque Global moved the needle on its ambitious University Hills mixed-use development in Southern Dallas, gaining momentum for the delayed project.\nThe Dallas-based firm executed a development agreement with the city for the 270-acre site, and it now has 60 days to buy the land, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe Dallas City Council\napproved amendments to the development agreement\nin December, extending deadlines and increasing the public subsidy to $35.9 million. The firm’s minimum investment requirement rose to $62 million, and it was tasked with selling an additional 50 lots to third-party builders.\nHoque must purchase the site by May 12 and secure construction funding by August 10. Arthur Santa-Maria, vice president at Hoque, said the firm is on track.\nUniversity Hills, near the University of North Texas at Dallas and Interstate 20, is envisioned as a transformative project for Southern Dallas.\nPlans call for thousands of residential units, 1.5 million square feet of commercial space and more than 50 acres of green space. The project could create a commercial hub in an area where median income levels are about 60 percent of the Dallas-Fort Worth average.\n\nHoque faced scrutiny from delays on other projects, and Dallas officials said the city would terminate the agreement if the firm missed any deadlines.\nIt missed a deadline last year for vertical construction at its\n$50 million mixed-use project\nin Mansfield, and it was\nremoved as the master developer\nfor the Evans and Rosedale Urban Village in Fort Worth last April, after the city cited “unacceptable delays.”\nHoque contested those claims but did not reapply for the project.\nThe firm last year sold 580 lots in University Hills to D.R. Horton and Lennar for townhome and single-family development. It is also a partner in the proposed\n$350 million redevelopment\nof downtown Dallas’ Bank of America Plaza with Mike Ablon of PegasusAblon.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "The state legislature is doubling down on the governor’s proposal to deter institutional investors from buying single-family homes in New York.\nSenate and Assembly Democrats on Tuesday released their responses to Gov. Kathy Hochul’s\nexecutive budget\n, both proposing more restrictions on these investors and higher tax rates for the state’s top earners.\nThe governor wants to bar institutional investors from bidding on single- and two-family homes for the first 75 days that these homes are on the market. The majorities of both chambers included this proposal in their budget resolutions, but also escalated efforts to kick these buyers out of the market — despite the\nlack of data\non the percentage of single-family homes owned by institutional investors in New York.\nThe Senate proposal includes\na bill\nsponsored by Sen. Liz Krueger and Assembly member Michaelle Solages, dubbed the End Hedge Fund Control of New York Homes Act. The measure would impose a tax worth 50 percent of the value of a single-family home (defined in the bill as having up to four units) on hedge funds, private equity firms and others when they purchase these properties.\nThe Assembly’s resolution seeks to discourage entities from scooping up single- and two-family homes. The Assembly has significantly broadened the definition of an institutional investor — characterizing it as someone with a net value of or assets worth $5 million or more, as opposed to the $50 million threshold pitched by the governor.\nThe proposal goes even further, establishing a fee equal to 10 percent of the purchase price and granting homeowners automatic protection from investors’ solicitations.\nState officials have not, however, been able to provide information demonstrating how\nprevalent\nthese purchases are in New York.\nDuring a budget hearing last month, RuthAnne Visnauskas, head of the Division of Homes and Community Renewal, said that mayors in Albany, Rochester and other cities have reported that hundreds of homes have been scooped up by such buyers. Visnauskas could not provide data.\nReports have repeatedly pegged the share of single-family homes owned by institutional investors at between 2 and 3 percent, though the percentages are higher in parts of the Sun Belt. A\nDecember report\nby CoreLogic showed mom-and-pop investors made up the lion’s share of so-called investor deals in New York City between January and June, as was the case in the 19 other top metro areas.\nBoth the Assembly and Senate excluded the governor’s proposal to curb the use of price-fixing software used to set rents.\nThese resolutions are not binding, but provide a snapshot of each chamber’s priorities heading into budget negotiations. As with the\ngovernor’s executive budget\n, these resolutions do not take any\nbig swings\nat ramping up housing construction. The Senate proposal indicates that the chamber is “open” to further discussing the Faith-Based Affordable Housing Act, which would make it easier for religious organizations to build affordable housing on their property.\nHousing ground rules\nIn December, Hochul pledged to commit $1 billion to help build housing in New York City. The funds helped secure approval of the\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n, which included several zoning changes aimed at making it easier to build an estimated 80,000 new housing units. The governor did not, however, specify how those funds would be\ndivided\n.\n\nThe Senate resolution specifies that a little more than half of that money, spread out over five years, should go to the New York City Housing Authority. The remaining $500 million would be divvied up between various efforts, including $150 million for the construction of new rental housing, $80 million for a mixed-income housing revolving loan fund and $50 million to preserve Mitchell-Lama housing.\nThe Assembly’s bill doesn’t address how the City of Yes funds should be distributed but calls for increased investments in supportive housing, community land trusts and other housing models.\nThe Democratic majorities of both chambers\nonce again\nincluded $250 million to fund a state-run housing voucher program. The proposal has garnered support from both tenant and real estate groups in recent years, but Hochul has repeatedly refused to back it.\nThe resolutions do not include much for owners of rent-stabilized apartments, who have urged lawmakers to provide more relief from the 2019 rent law, which severely limited rent increases on these apartments. The\nstate budget\nlast year slightly raised the amount that landlords who renovate apartments can increase rents, but owners argue this will barely make a dent in the level of distress seen across stabilized properties.\nThe Assembly resolution, however, includes a $275 million tax credit for renters with incomes lower than $200,000. The benefit would be capped at $750.\nHigher taxes for millionaires, tax credits for tenants\nThe governor’s proposed budget called for extending the state’s millionaire’s tax for another five years. The rates, the highest of which is 10.9 percent and applies to those earning more than $25 million, are slated to expire in 2027. The Assembly and Senate proposed extending the tax and increasing the rates, with the Senate pushing an increase of .5 percent on the two top tier earners, and the Assembly advocating for increases across the board, with the highest rate becoming 12 percent.\nHochul also floated extending the state’s film production tax credit for two years, as well as pushing the deadline for a tax credit provided to certain businesses that move to locations above 96th Street in Manhattan or the other boroughs. Both the Assembly and the Senate resolutions exclude extensions to the latter, known as the Relocation and Employment Assistance Program.\nThe two budget resolutions also call for an expansion of the types of projects where developers must pay construction workers prevailing wages. Such wage requirements kick in when project costs exceed $5 million and if at least 30 percent of the project is funded through public money. The Assembly and Senate are pushing to reduce that threshold to 20 percent, and to eliminate a board that was given the authority to determine which projects must pay these higher wages. The head of the Real Estate Board of New York and the Building and Construction Trades Council are members of the board.\nIn an\nop-ed for amNY\n, Gary LaBarbera, president of the New York City and state chapters of the BCTC, said the board  is “at its best ineffective and at its worst, a roadblock.” He noted that the board has only approved six projects since it was created in 2022.\nTwo bills strongly opposed by the real estate industry were not included in the resolutions, including a measure that would cap increases on ground-lease rent at co-ops, nor\nanother\nthat would make it easier for localities outside New York City to adopt rent stabilization.\nThe budget is due April 1.\n",

    "content": "There could soon be a new high-water mark for industrial sales on Long Island.\nPlainview-based Rechler Equity Partners is shopping the Hampton Business District in Westhampton Beach, according to Green Street. Bidding for the five-building, 385,000-square-foot industrial park on the East End is expected to top $200 million.\nThe five-acre campus at 200, 215, 220, 230 and 245 Roger’s Way was completed five years ago. The property is 94 percent leased by two dozen tenants, who have a weighted average remaining term of more than seven years. Among the major tenants are Amazon and Iron Mountain; Amazon is responsible for 27 percent of the property’s income.\nThere’s room for growth on the rent front, though. The rents in place are 17.5 percent below market rate, on average.\nThe property benefits from proximity to the local airport and Sunrise Highway, connecting the campus with much of Long Island. The rare industrial park in the Hamptons also provides access to e-commerce demand in the area, which saw such sales rise by 30 percent each year since 2020 — double the national rate.\nJLL has the listing for the property. Should a sale price come close to the projections, it would shatter Long Island’s industrial record, Starwood Capital’s $146 million acquisition of an asset in Inwood two years ago.\n\nThere have been a number of big industrial deals on the island in recent months.\nIn September, Bahrain-based Investcorp purchased a five-property, 435,000-square-foot industrial portfolio in Suffolk County from a joint venture between Metropolitan Realty Associates and TPG Angelo Gordon\nfor $95.8 million\n.\nTwo months later, NorthBridge Partners\npaid $105.7 million\nto purchase two Bay Shore properties from the Rockefeller Group.\nIn the fourth quarter, leasing activity in Long Island’s industrial market fell to 389,000 square feet, the lowest total in two years, according to\nCBRE\n. Occupancy shrank by 246,000 square feet while the vacancy rate rose to 7 percent.\n",

    "content": "Seaport Entertainment Group is looking to sell the controversial site in the Financial District that Howard Hughes Holding Company spent years trying to develop.\nSEG is marketing 250 Water Street to interested parties, Crain’s\nreported\n. There’s no asking price associated with the listing, but the land’s gross carrying value is $143 million, according to an annual report from the owner.\n“The best value for the company is going to be realized either through an outright sale to a developer and an operator who specializes in multi-family and mixed-use developments, or to partner with someone with this expertise,” SEG chief executive officer Anton Nikodemus said on a conference call on Tuesday.\nJLL is fielding bids for the site.\nIt’s a stunning aboutface after all of the\nlegal wrangling\nover the site, which Howard Hughes spent years trying to develop; SEG was spun out from Howard Hughes in August.\n\nHoward Hughes purchased the site for $180 million in 2018 after the seller, the Mistein family, repeatedly tried and failed to secure approval to build on the site. Howard Hughes received final approval to do so at the end of 2021.\nBut in July 2022, the South Street Seaport Coalition\nfiled a lawsuit\nchallenging the Landmark Preservation Commission’s approval of the project. In 2023, a judge voided the approval, citing an “impermissible quid pro quo” between the developer and the LPC. A panel of appellate judges later\nreversed\nthat decision.\nThe site’s development approval is for 26 stories and 399 units. Howard Hughes broke ground in 2022 and placed foundation footings by June 15, 2022, so the site qualifies for the 421a tax abatement after the completion deadline for the program was extended to June 2031.\nSEG also signed interactive art exhibitor Meow Wolf to a 20-year,\n75,000-square-foot lease\nat Pier 17. Construction for the buildout is scheduled to begin in the third quarter.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "The Florida Legislature is considering bills this session that target two of the thorniest issues at condo and homeowners associations: alleged fraud and structural requirements.\nFor decades, some communities have been hotbeds for board members’\nalleged mismanagement and fraud\n. In the biggest fraud case in recent years, authorities in 2022 charged four former board members of the\nHammocks HOA\nand the husband of one of the ex-board members with misappropriating association funds to the tune of $2 million. The Hammocks, home to more than 18,000 residents in West Kendall, is South Florida’s biggest HOA.\nTo combat fraud, this legislative session’s bills seek to introduce an investigations pilot program and expand the powers of state oversight agencies.\nOther bills deal with hefty structural safety requirements imposed on condo associations following the deadly\nChamplain Towers South\ncollapse in Surfside in 2021. Since then, state lawmakers beefed up mandates in hopes of ensuring buildings’ safety. By the end of last year, all Florida condo associations were supposed to complete structural integrity reserve studies (SIRS). Starting this year, they are required to fully fund reserves. Condo associations also face milestone inspections once buildings reach 30 years, and every 10 years afterward.\nBut these requirements have proven to be a financial burden on unit owners. Many are getting hit with\nmultimillion-dollar special assessments\nto pay for repairs.\nBills proposed this session aim to give condo associations a reprieve from structural requirements, including giving options to finance repairs.\nThe legislative session started on March 4 and ends on May 2.\nSB 120/HB 137\nState lawmakers want to appoint an HOAs ombudsman, after they\nfailed to approve a similar proposal at last year’s session\n.\nCurrently, the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) has less oversight over HOAs than condo associations. While DBPR’s administrative staff includes a condo ombudsman, the department does not have one for HOAs.\nUnder the proposed bills, the HOAs ombudsman will serve as a liaison among homeowners, boards of directors, association managers, DBPR and others, as well as develop policies and procedures so residents and boards understand their rights and responsibilities. The ombudsman will be able to mediate between homeowners and association leaders, as well as monitor and review complaints and recommend investigations by DBPR if election tampering is suspected.\nThe ombudsman also can appoint a board elections monitor if 15 percent of homeowners or six homeowners, whichever is greater, vote for this. The association would pay for the monitor.\nThe governor would appoint the ombudsman, who will have to be an attorney. The position will be within DBPR’s Division of Florida Condominiums, Timeshares, and Mobile Homes.\nSen. Danny Burgess, a Republican whose district includes parts of Hillsborough and Pasco counties, and Rep. Jervonte “Tae” Edmonds, a Democrat representing a portion of Palm Beach County, introduced the bills.\nSB 368\nThis bill again brings up an initiative Florida lawmakers failed to approve last year: a fraud investigation pilot program.\nThis year’s version is broader than that of last year, which only sought to create the program for condo associations. Under the latest bill, the state would initiate the Economic Crime, Fraud and Corruption Investigation Pilot Program for both condo and homeowners associations within the Florida Legal Affairs Department.\nThe bill aims to give HOAs a state ombudsman by expanding the existing condo association ombudsman’s powers to HOAs. The proposal will allow the ombudsman to void an election if voting issues are determined, request a court-appointed receiver for an association, issue subpoenas and conduct association audits.\nUnder the bill, the ombudsman would review complaints and decide which should be sent to the Economic Crime, Fraud and Corruption Investigation Pilot Program. If the staff of the pilot program determines the alleged wrongdoing is not within their purview, they would forward the complaint to DBPR’s condo, timeshares and mobile homes division.\nTo aid the pilot program’s investigation, the state will subpoena and audit association records. If sufficient evidence of corruption is found, complaints will be forwarded to state attorney’s offices.\nThe pilot program, which would sunset on Oct. 2, 2030, unless the legislature renews it, would be based in Miami-Dade County. It would be funded from DBPR’s Division of Florida Condominiums, Timeshares, and Mobile Homes Trust Fund.\nThe bill’s other provisions include a requirement on condo associations to establish a searchable, cloud-based database with information about each association in Florida, including the names and contact information of board members; governing documents such as declarations and by-laws; annual budgets, including regular and special assessments, as well as their purpose; and copies of SIRS and other reports on a property’s physical condition.\nThe bill gives DBPR the right to levy fines on condo associations that fail to maintain insurance or a fidelity bond.\nFinally, the bill spells out procedures for HOAs to levy fines on homeowners, including that these fees can’t be more than $1,000, and levy suspensions on homeowners if they violate association declarations or by-laws. If a homeowner fixes a violation before his/her hearing, the association can’t levy the fine or suspension. If a homeowner cures an issue within 30 days after a hearing, the fine is halved and the suspension lifted. Also, fines won’t be due earlier than 30 days after a hearing. If a homeowner fails to pay a fine, the association also will be owed attorney fees.\n\nThe bill was introduced by Sen. Ileana Garcia, a Republican who represents part of Miami-Dade.\nHB 983/SB 1600\nBoth bills say that a homeowner’s voting rights cannot be suspended when voting in a board recall. This includes lifting all previous suspensions to allow the homeowner to cast a recall ballot.\nThe proposals come as residents at some South Florida condo associations and HOAs have filed recall petitions, seeking to replace board members over various allegations, including mismanagement. In some cases, boards reviewing recall petitions deemed some homeowners’ votes invalid due to suspensions\nover reasons such as overdue assessments\n.\nUnder the bills, boards have to hold a meeting within five business days after receiving a recall petition to decide its validity.\nThe bills’ other proposals include that at least 20 percent of homeowners have to cast ballots in board elections for the elections to be valid.\nHB 983 also creates amenity dues at HOAs, which are different from assessments. Homeowners would pay the amenity dues to private owners of recreational facilities at HOAs to use these facilities.\nHB 983 was co-introduced by Rep. Juan Carlos Porras, a Republican representing a portion of Miami-Dade County, and Rep. Meg Weinberger, a Republican representing a portion of Palm Beach County. Sen. Kristen Aston Arrington, a Democrat representing Osceola County and a portion of Orange County, introduced SB 1600.\nHB 913\nIn an attempt to enforce compliance with SIRS, a lawmaker proposes withholding coverage by\nCitizens Property Insurance\n, the state carrier of last resort, from condo associations that fail to meet structural integrity requirements.\nThe proposal comes as associations already have been struggling to obtain insurance due to several underwriters exiting the state and increased\npremiums and deductibles\nfrom the insurers still in Florida.\nThe bill also could be beneficial to developers who purchase a bulk of units at aging condo buildings and seek to dissolve the condo association. Specifically, the proposal eases the undoing of the association governing structure at buildings where repair costs exceed the property’s value.\nRep. Vicki Lopez, a Republican whose district includes Key Biscayne and parts of Miami, introduced the bill.\nSB 1742\nUnder this bill, condo associations can invest reserve funds in depository accounts for community, savings and commercial banks, or in credit unions.\nCondo boards are to create investment committees consisting of two board members and two unit owners who aren’t board members. The committee will recommend an investment adviser to be hired to manage reserve fund investment portfolios. Any interest earned on the portfolios that isn’t allocated for specific association uses has to be spent on capital improvements or maintenance.\nThe bill also aims to give a reprieve to condo associations facing higher expenses to meet structural integrity requirements. For budgets adopted prior to or on Dec. 31, 2028, unit owners can vote for their association to obtain a line of credit to help cover reserve funds required under SIRS.\nSB 1742 also proposes that associations with budgets approved prior to or on Dec. 31, 2028, that completed their milestone inspections in the previous two years, can temporarily pause reserve funding in order to finance repairs determined as necessary under the inspections. Associations that completed milestone inspections can delay their SIRS for up to two years to allow them to direct their funds to cover repairs.\nThe bill also aims to curb conflicts of interest between companies that conduct SIRS and contractors that do the repairs outlined as necessary under SIRS. It mandates that SIRS recommend reserve funding schedules in addition to determining necessary repairs.\nSen. Jennifer Bradley, a Republican representing the northern part of the state, introduced the bill. Her district includes part of Alachua County, as well as Baker, Bradford, Clay, Columbia, Gilchrist and Union counties.\nSB 690/HB 1415\nThe bills mark another attempt by state lawmakers to give condo associations a reprieve from the stricter structural integrity requirements imposed after the Surfside collapse.\nUnder the proposals, the SIRS requirement will be scaled back to condo buildings that are six stories or taller.\nAssociations for condo buildings that are five stories or shorter can elect, through a vote of unit owners, to waive funding reserves or to reduce reserve funding.\nSen. Rosalind Osgood, a Democrat representing part of Broward County, introduced SB 690, and Rep. Bruce Hadley Antone, a Democrat representing part of Orange County introduced HB 1415.",

    "content": "Nineteen West 46th Street is not the thinnest building in Manhattan. It’s not even the second-thinnest. But at just 12 and one-quarter feet wide, it is perhaps the third-thinnest of the borough’s 47,000 buildings.\nA passerby might miss the building entirely if they happened to glance down at their phone for a moment. And that would be a shame.\n“It’s an interesting little building,” said Scott Weinberg, a real estate attorney who works nearby. “I deal with buildings all the time in my work. I like walking around the city and seeing things that you wouldn’t think should be there, given all the development that’s going on.”\n“Little” is an understatement. It’s so narrow that on a basketball court, it would fit between the free-throw line and the front of the rim, with a foot to spare.\nLike all unusual buildings in New York City, 19 West 46th Street has a story behind it. Built in 1865, the brownstone is a lone relic from an era when the block between Fifth and Sixth avenues was entirely residential.\n“Mine’s the last man standing,” said Sean Sedaghatpour, whose\nGreat Neck-based\nElisheva Realty bought the building in 2021 for $2.65 million.\nSedaghatpour said he does not specialize in skinny buildings. But as it happens, he also owns a 10-foot-wide building at 210 East 52nd Street, possibly the borough’s second-thinnest, according to property records. (The narrowest building, at 75 ½ Bedford Street, is nine and one-half feet wide).\n\nNineteen West 46th Street was built by a developer who bought one of the last remaining lots on the block and divided it in half, according to the blog\nDaytonian in Manhattan\n. He built two matching townhouses at 17 and 19, hoping to maximize profits.\nBut one twin was demolished in the 1920s to make way for a 10-story office building. That property is\nnow owned by\nGary Barnett’s Extell Development, which is planning a\n32-story office tower\non the corner. It is unclear what Barnett’s plans are for the office building, which was set to be demolished by the previous owner. A spokesperson for Extell did not respond to a request for comment.\nOn the other side, Jack Elo’s eponymous firm bought the\n15-story office building\nat 21 West 46th Street, which he plans to keep as an office.\nThe tiny townhouse remains, although the stoop was removed in 1911 when the parlor and ground floors were renovated for commercial use. A variety of businesses have occupied the building, including a perfume store, antiques dealer, and a bartending school. It’s now a Spanish Tapas restaurant.\nThe upper floors are apartments, and Sedaghatpour said he has no immediate plans to sell the building. An unknown developer swooping in to buy the tiny parcel seems unlikely anyway.\n“It’s a very tiny building, so it doesn’t really have any potential except for me buying it or the owner on the other side buying it,” Elo said. “And I don’t think that’s going to happen.”\n",

    "content": "In a sober reminder of how apartment projects can go wrong, the bankruptcy auction for Eli Karp’s former Hello Nostrand development site in Brooklyn is scheduled for April 8, according to a Northgate\nlisting\n.\nThe pending auction, which also includes a 94-unit building that Karp finished at 21 East 29th Street. Bidding, which ends at 5 p.m. April 7, starts at $57 million.\nOne fascinating detail revealed by the auction listing is that the East 29th Street building is one unit shy of qualifying for the crucial 421a tax break. Work on the 94th unit is said to be underway. The project’s underwriting surely assumed it would get 421a, without which multifamily projects typically do not pencil out.\nKarp famously blamed Josh Zegen’s Madison Realty Capital for buying the debt on his projects and charging default interest, creating a mountain of debt that he could never pay down. Madison pointed out that had Karp paid his original lenders as promised, none of that would have occurred.\n“I can’t get around how this happened,” Karp\nsaid in 2021\n. “I have lost everything.”\nKarp put the Nostrand and East 29th Street sites into bankruptcy that year, one day before Madison’s scheduled foreclosure sale, as\nThe Real Deal\n’s Keith Larsen\nreported\n. More drama followed at Karp’s\n2415 Albemarle Road\ncondo and other “Hello Living” projects. Elizabeth Cryan wrote about the saga\nin October\n.\nKarp did one thing right: He put footings in the ground of the empty lot at 1580 Nostrand Avenue so it could qualify for 421a, which is necessary to get financing for a multifamily project there.\nKarp’s Hello Living, which built 10 projects and planned six others, bought the site for $13 million in 2014. The Nostrand parcel is now zoned for 216 units, thanks to a 20 percent boost from City of Yes, which also reduced the required number of parking spots.\nThose good breaks came far too late for Karp, but make the site more attractive to another developer. Time will tell if one tries to make a go of it.\nWhat we’re thinking about:\nEvery skyscraper constructed in Philadelphia — including its 10 tallest buildings — since the Center City Commuter Connection linked the Reading and Pennsylvania Railroads in 1983 is within a 10-minute walk of a station that was part of the project. That’s a real estate argument that advocates make in calling for Penn Station to be converted from a terminal to through-running. Do you support that idea? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we’ve learned:\nAs Kathryn Brenzel reported in yesterday’s\nDaily Dirt\n, nearly 34,000 homes were completed last year (the most since 1965), but fewer than 16,000 received permits. What’s the difference between those terms? A permit is granted for construction to start; a completion means a certificate of occupancy is issued. The low permit number for 2024 signals that\na production drought is coming\n. If you like to explore rabbit holes or just nerd out, dive into the city’s\nHousing Database\n.\nElsewhere…\nA dispute between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews at Beth Jacob Ohev Sholom, the oldest Orthodox synagogue in Brooklyn and the only non-Hasidic one in Williamsburg, centers on the building itself. “Each side is accusing the other of\nplotting to sell the property\n, raze the temple and construct condos in its wake,” Gothamist\nreported\n.\nMichael Alvandi’s\nCity Urban Realty\nbought an 88-unit building at 244 West 72nd Street for $40 million from Fred and Nader Ohebshalom and other family members. The sale for the 16-story building, which dates to 1928 and also has four commercial spaces, works out to $450 per square foot. Israel Discount Bank of New York provided a $31.7 million mortgage.\nI asked Alvandi what motivated the purchase.\n\n“Elevated debt costs and long-term capital obligations are creating forced sales and generational opportunities like this one,” he said. “Multifamily and retail in certain pockets still have room to run.”\nIn a press release, Alvandi had said the firm planned to “breathe new life into the tired building.”\nCity Urban’s business model is to find properties in good locations that need rehabilitating and repositioning. It’s basically the commercial version of the adage, “Buy the worst house in the best neighborhood.”\nBrooklyn’s Jimmy McMillan etched his name in history with the phrase “the rent is too damn high,” but\nrenting is now more economical than owning\nin all of the 100 largest U.S. metro areas, according to a new LendingTree analysis.\nThe difference between median gross rent ($1,406) and median housing costs ($1,904) for homes with a mortgage is $498 a month, the company found. The largest differences are in San Francisco ($1,414), Bridgeport ($1,367), and New York ($1,340).\nOne comment:\nEt tu\n, Bridgeport?\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Tuesday was\n$14.5 million\nfor a co-op unit at 65 Central Park West in Lincoln Square. Katie Thurber and Ryan Serhant\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$103.3 million\nfor three lots at 35-39 East 60th Street in Lenox Hill.\nExtell Development\npurchased the property from\nSolil Management\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$34 million\nfor a co-op unit at 101 Central Park West on the Upper West Side. Alexa Lambert of Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building applications filed were for a combined 82,600-square-foot, 96-unit affordable housing project at 543-545 East 181st Street in East Tremont. Architect Amie Gross filed the permits on behalf of PIBLY Residential Programs.\n— Matthew Elo",

    "content": "It is unfair, we keep hearing, that housing development has been concentrated in a few neighborhoods.\nFor the New York City real estate industry, this narrative is a double-edged sword. I will explain why in a moment.\nBut first, the data: Last year, about the same number of permits for new homes were issued in 10 community districts as in the other 49 combined.\nThat is extreme, and it wasn’t an anomaly. This lopsided disparity in housing production has persisted for years.\nCalling this “unfair” is a way to get the City Council members representing the 49 unproductive districts to rezone for more housing.\nBut pro-housing advocates and city officials making the fairness argument often make the mistake of framing housing development as a “burden” that 10 districts are shouldering. Other communities, they say, should do their “fair share.”\nExcuse me, but “fair share” is a phrase used for siting homeless shelters, methadone clinics and waste transfer stations. Yet somehow, it is coming up in discussions of multifamily projects — the very lifeblood of the city’s housing stock.\nRather than projects being portrayed as investment in a community, they are cast as negative, as a kind of noxious medicine that must be tolerated in the interests of equity.\n\nPerhaps in NIMBY communities it is effective to appeal to certain elected officials’ sense of fairness or guilt. That might have been a factor in progressive Council member Shahana Hanif’s approval of the\nArrow Linen rezoning\n; she knew Windsor Terrace had contributed precious little of the housing so desperately needed by working-class New Yorkers.\nBut to me, the jury is still out on the shaming strategy. Just look at how the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity played out. The measure\npassed by just 31-20\n, and only after being watered down. It will add a modest 5,300 units annually over 15 years.\nNot long ago, real estate investment was seen as a good thing. In some circles it still is.\nOpportunity Zones\n, for example, were created by congressional Republicans in 2018 as a way to spur investment in economically struggling areas.\nThe same was true for Empowerment Zones, a bipartisan federal program. New York City has two EZs, in\nUpper Manhattan and the South Bronx\n, and\n306 census tracts\nthat qualify as Opportunity Zones.\nNew York state also has\nEmpire Zones\n, including in East New York, South Jamaica, East Harlem, Hunts Point, Sunset Park/Red Hook, Far Rockaway, the Brooklyn Navy Yard and Staten Island’s North Shore. Investment in these low-income areas was incentivized by tax breaks.\nYet apartment projects are pitched as if they were chemotherapy for communities that don’t think they have cancer. No one should be surprised when they are rejected.\nIt’s not fun to live next to construction, and change is hard for people who like their communities the way they are. But new housing is beneficial for neighborhoods, as well as for the city as a whole. Calling it a burden is doing more harm than good.\n",

    "content": "A megalisting priced at $175 million has hit the market in what’s been a drawn-out saga for a piece of Benedict Canyon once slated for a\nBulgari-branded hotel\n.\nThe 15-parcel listing includes the 9712 West Oak Pass Road address among several others in the hillside of Los Angeles. The listing states the property is located in Beverly Hills Post Office, a Los Angeles neighborhood north of the city of Beverly Hills. It also includes two single-family residences at 9800 Wanda Park Drive and 2534 Hutton Drive.\nRecords through PropertyShark and listing sites note the property is in pre-foreclosure after a notice of default was sent in November, alleging a $49.7 million unpaid balance at that time.\nThe notice of default indicates Motcomb Estates Ltd. provided a $30 million loan to 9712 Oak Pass Road LLC, which Florida state records show is tied to developer Gary Safady.\nMotcomb handles property investments for real estate investment and development firm Reuben Brothers, which is helmed by billionaires David and Simon Reuben.\nThe Agency’s Adam Rosenfeld and Feroz Taj have the listing and declined, through a brokerage spokesperson, to comment on the property outside of confirming only one seller is involved.\nDavid Reuben Jr., Reuben Brothers principal and co-founder of Blackship Advisors, declined to comment. The Reubens’ attorney, Eric Orenstein of Rosenberg &amp; Estis, did not respond for comment.\nLuxe Ambitions\nThe mega-property was a point of contention a few years ago when Safady planned for a Bulgari-branded hotel.\nAn initial study for the project, when it was known as The Retreat at Benedict Canyon, called for a 59-room hotel along with eight single-family residences. The latter were to each total anywhere from 12,000 to 48,000 square feet, according to city planning documents.\nThe project drew the ire of some locals who were against the expected impacts of the large-scale construction project.\n\n“I believe we’ve taken the time to address all those issues,” Safady, who could not be immediately reached for comment Tuesday, told\nVoyageLA\nin April 2023.\nA few months after that interview ran, then-\nCity Planning Director Vincent Bertoni\nwrote to Safady that the project’s impact to the area was far greater than originally expected, effectively ending the entitlement process for the resort.\nMike Gatto, an attorney for Safady, told the\nLos Angeles Times\nfollowing the city’s decision to axe the project it sent “a message to all looking to invest in Los Angeles that the city can’t be trusted to follow its own rules.”\nGatto, reached Tuesday afternoon, said he wasn’t aware of any backup development plans following the city’s 2023 decision, which is when his retainer agreement with Safady ended.\n“Usually when there is a presence of a NIMBY group in an area, they make it so that whatever somebody proposes is going to be tough. Those factors would have made it very hard to build anything there,” Gatto told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nPricey Properties\nOak Pass Road now ranks as the third-priciest property on the market within Los Angeles County, according to Zillow records.\nThe county’s most expensive property currently for sale is Westside Estate Agency’s listing at 1261 Angelo Drive in Beverly Hills, which has a $195 million price tag. WEA founders Kurt Rappaport and Stephen Shapiro are marketing the property.\nAngelo Drive, also known as the\nPritzker Estate\n, gets its name from Hyatt Hotel heir Anthony Pritzker who built the 50,000-square-foot mega mansion with his now ex-wife Jeanne Pritzker. It has 16 bedrooms and 27 bathrooms.\nThe next priciest property on the market is 607 Siena Way, which is priced at $177 million by The Beverly Hills Estates’ Branden Williams and Rayni Williams. The eight-bed, 25-bath Villa Siena estate spans 35,000 square feet and hit the market in February.\n",

    "content": "The owners of a Newport Beach apartment complex by the Back Bay want to expand it by 366 units — at $800,000 a pop.\nDallas-based Park Newport LP has filed plans to expand its Park Newport Apartments at 1 Park Newport,\nthe Orange County Business Journal reported.\nThe 1,306-unit complex on 52 acres would expand by 366 apartments at a cost of $800,000 each. The total outlay: $293 million.\nThe sprawling complex along the bluffs of Upper Newport Bay sits across Jamboree Road from the Fashion Island mall. The complex, built a half century ago by Gerson Bakar &amp; Associates, has 44 two- and three-story buildings, plus seven pools, a clubhouse and 10 sport courts.\nResidents of Park Newport have included actors Telly Savalas and Raquel Welch, and athletes Joe Torre, Bobby Riggs and Dennis Rodman.\nThe property is now owned by San Francisco-based Prado Group, according to the Business Journal. It’s not clear how Park Newport, or a Park Newport Land it said was involved in the expansion, are tied.\nPlans for the 6-acre expansion call for demolishing a leasing building, reflecting pool, tennis court and a 260-vehicle parking structure, as well as six apartments.\nThe landlord would then build 360 new apartments, including 285 market-rate units and 15 set aside for low-income tenants. The other 60 new apartments are “density bonus” residences, an indication of affordable housing units, according to the Business Journal.\n\nThe project would include 40 studio, 138 one-bedroom, 151 two-bedroom and 31 three-bedroom apartments, with an average size of 950 square feet. It would also include a 12,000-square-foot amenity space and 7,000 square feet of shops.\nThe expansion of the largest apartment complex near Fashion Island is the latest development among other multifamily projects in the works.\nLocally based Irvine Company recently proposed a combined 800 apartment units at Villas of Fashion Island at 1000 San Joaquin Plaza and Newport Center’s Block 100, a four-building multifamily project at 11 Newport Center Drive.\nThe firm also wants to convert part of an office campus at MacArthur Court near John Wayne Airport into\n700 homes\n.\nThe upscale coastal city has a state-mandated plan to build\n4,845 homes by 2029\n, of which 2,386 would be affordable for very low-income and low-income households.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

They claim a fire exit on a centrally located stair, as practiced in Europe, is a far more manageable and “economically defensible” design.\n\nWhile common practice in European cities,\nSeattle has led the charge on single-stair reform\nin the U.S. Decades ago, the city tweaked its building code to allow for single-stair buildings up to six stories.\nWhile New York followed suit, Raman pointed out that\nSan Francisco\nand San Diego are also exploring single-stair rules after the passage of\nAssembly Bill 835\n, which directs the state fire marshal to develop standards for single-stair buildings by 2028.\nRaman’s motion seeks numerous reports on a single-stair regulation from the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety, Fire Department and the Planning Department, as well as the Livable Cities Initiatives and the American Institute of Architects.\nLikewise, the motion asks the Planning Department to report back on existing regulations in cities where single-stair buildings are allowed.\n“While the requirement for two stairwells was originally adopted for fire safety, developments over the past two to three decades have made such requirements obsolete,” explains\na landing page on the California YIMBY website\n. “Modern buildings across the U.S. and Europe have fire safety ratings that greatly exceed buildings with two staircases — even though they only have one staircase.”\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

The five-story building was sold for $43.25 million in 2014, setting a record at $319 per square foot.\nThe owner is a subsidiary of New York REIT Global Net Lease.\nThe building, at 127 International Drive in Franklin’s Cool Springs area, was built-to-suit for the IRS in 2012 by New York-based Acquest Development. Valued at $4.6 million annually, the lease is expected to save the United States government less than $32 million, according to DOGE’s\nwebsite\n.\nThe lease termination is notable for its size and its implications in markets like Franklin, where large government tenants can drive valuations. Trump is\nat war with the IRS\n, which has been the sole tenant in the building.\n\nDOGE, which was created by President Donald Trump through executive order but lacks Congressional approval as an official agency, has focused on slashing vacant or underutilized federal leases across the country. Its “wall of receipts” website claims it has terminated 748 federal leases totaling 9.5 million square feet, including five in Middle Tennessee, as of March 11.\nFor Franklin and Cool Springs, the IRS lease termination removes one of its largest federal footprints and could reshape the area’s office market as the building seeks a new purpose or tenant.\nNashville’s office vacancy rate was 18 percent in the fourth quarter, lower than the then national rate of 20.4 percent, according to Colliers. The city\nset the pace for office demand\nlast year, but Franklin’s vacancy rate was 24 percent in 2023, according to CommercialCafe.\n— Judah Duke\n",

Construction starts this spring, with completion anticipated by the end of 2027.\nThe project targets 73,200 square feet of destination and retail experiences designed to blend with Fredericksburg’s aesthetic appeal. The hotel brand hasn’t been revealed. Colliers’ Wade Green and Hannah Schiro are handling retail leasing.\nDallas-based Merriman Anderson Architects, the firm behind Dallas’ Statler Hotel revitalization, is leading design efforts, with Chicago-based Curioso handling the hotel interiors. Satterfield &amp; Pontikes, from Houston, is the construction manager.\nFredericksburg officials signaled their support for the project, saying it especially aligns with the city’s efforts to boost midweek tourism.\n\nThe Hill Country town has long been known for its small-town charm and robust tourism fueled by its wineries and German heritage. It was named one of the “most picturesque towns in America” by Reader’s Digest last year and received $1.4 million in American Rescue Plan funding in 2022 for infrastructure updates to accommodate swelling tourism.\nThe town was dubbed\n“the new Aspen”\nby Texas Monthly in 2021 for its high population of wealthy people and its part-time residents.\nCentral Texas is growing rapidly, and the Austin/San Antonio region is merging into a massive metro area.\nCrescent Real Estate is capitalizing on growing demand for upscale homes in the Texas Hill Country by developing a luxury residential project called Atten Hill in Horseshoe Bay, featuring 92 custom home sites on 114 acres, with prices starting around $500,000. The first phase will include 55 homes, and residents will enjoy exclusive amenities, including golf courses and a $40 million clubhouse.\n— Judah Duke\n",

It was snuffed out in an hour and 37 minutes.\nThe property appears to have been a two-story industrial building in front, backed by a 13,000-square-foot brick-and-timber warehouse, according to Loopnet and Google Maps.\nThe blaze was reported at 1:43 a.m. in the building between Venice and Pico boulevards, a couple of blocks east of the Los Angeles Convention Center and not far from Crypto.com Arena and L.A. Live, according to Margaret Stewart, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Fire Department.\nFirefighters arrived and found flames erupting from two parts of the building, she said. Video showed flames through the roof, which the fire department said had been the site of a fire in November.\n\nCrews found heavy fire in the one-story portion at the back and were able to knock the bulk of the fire down in about 15 minutes.\n“However, the situation escalated as flames rapidly spread into the adjacent one-story commercial building,” Stewart said. “Approximately 20 minutes into the incident, smoke and fire were visible in a separate, one-story commercial building two doors to the south.”\nThe scores of firefighters managed to douse the blaze by 3:20 a.m. No injuries were reported. It’s not clear whether the building had been occupied.\n“They fought the heavy fire for over an hour and successfully defended two exposed buildings — an auto body shop and four-story apartment building to the rear,” Stewart said. “Occupants of the apartment building were able to safely shelter in place, and no evacuation was required.”\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

The project would center around a five-story building featuring 7,500 square feet of retail — including a grocery store, cafe, community art center and pop-up retail — alongside 46 mixed-income residential units.\nThe project’s first phase would cost $39 million, funded by tax-increment financing, low-income housing tax credits, City of Chicago funds and a ComEd affordable housing grant. Subsequent phases would add more retail, residential units and outdoor community spaces.\nChicago Neighborhood Initiatives, with the Far South Chicago Community Development Corporation and designers Beehyyve and Gensler, proposed 1Fifteen at Michigan Station. It includes a four-story building with a 15,000-square-foot anchor grocery store, an 8,000-square-foot market hall for small businesses and 58 affordable apartments.\n\nAdditional phases envision retail, residential and community space, including townhomes and walk-up apartments surrounding a community park.\n1Fifteen’s initial phase is estimated to cost $48.3 million, supported by $15.8 million in tax credits, $26.7 million in government subsidies, $5.5 million in debt and $300,000 in philanthropic funds.\nBoth proposals emphasize sustainability and community connection and environmentally friendly elements, such as with solar panels, green roofs and rain gardens incorporated into their designs.\nThe city has opened the proposals to comment via an online survey. Residents can respond through March 21, but the city hasn’t said when the winner will be selected.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "Interactive art is set to take shape across part of the South Street Seaport.\nSeaport Entertainment Group, a spinoff of Howard Hughes Holdings,\nannounced\nthat Meow Wolf has signed a 20-year lease for approximately 75,000 square feet across multiple floors at Pier 17 in Manhattan’s Seaport district.\nThe asking rent was not disclosed. A representative for SEG did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe venue will be Meow Wolf’s seventh permanent exhibition and first on the East Coast. Meow Wolf operates in Santa Fe, Las Vegas, Denver, Dallas and Houston. A Los Angeles location is scheduled to open in 2026.\nThe attraction will join existing Pier 17 venues including The Rooftop concert venue and Lawn Club. SEG expects the Meow Wolf experience to bring millions of additional visitors to the waterfront area annually.\nAnton Nikodemus, SEG’s chief executive officer, noted in a statement that Meow Wolf’s artistic approach aligns with the Seaport’s history as a creative hub. Jose Tolosa, Meow Wolf’s chief executive officer, described the Seaport as “a place where New York’s history and future intersect.”\n\nMeow Wolf began in Santa Fe in 2008 as an art collective and has gone on to create immersive, interactive art installations across the country. The company has received critical acclaim, including Time Out’s #1 Immersive Experience in the US and appearances on Fast Company’s World’s 50 Most Innovative Companies list.\nConstruction at Pier 17 is scheduled to begin in the third quarter of 2025. The opening date, theme and other details have not yet been announced.\nCBRE was the dual leasing agent. Mary Ann Tighe, Gerry Miovski and Evan Haskell were among those to represent the landlord in the transaction, while Cassie Durand, Sacha Zarba and Aylin Gucalp represented the tenant.\nSEG is run by Nikodemus and was\nspun out\nof Howard Hughes in August, turning the latter into a pure real estate company. SEG includes nearly 500,000 square feet of retail, entertainment and dining space in lower Manhattan. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management owns about 38 percent of the entity.\nHospitality brand Grupo Gitano recently\ninked a lease\nat 89 South Street in the Seaport District building, where it plans to open its first permanent eatery in the United States.\n",

    "content": "Developers trying to make lemonade out of the Trump administration’s plan to offload North Texas’ federal buildings will need a lot of sugar.\nThe General Services Administration’s list of buildings around the country that are burning a hole in the government’s pocket included five office buildings (and one small parking garage) in Dallas-Fort Worth totalling 1.7 million square feet.\nNone of them provide a quick and easy path to redevelopment.\nThe offerings include the mammoth Fritz G. Lanham Federal Building in downtown Fort Worth as well as three buildings in downtown Dallas, ranging from from 190,000 square feet to 261,000 square feet. There’s also a 317,000-square-foot building in the Dallas suburb of Farmers Branch.\nThe most exciting conversion prospect is the historic Santa Fe Federal Building at 1114 Commerce Street in downtown Dallas. Dallas developer Tanya Ragan could see it becoming a mixed-use project with a hotel, office, retail and most important, a “fabulous rooftop.”\n“It would be one of the best views in the city, because you’re adjacent to so many historic sites,” she said. “There are strict height restrictions and no obstructions.”\nThe expense, however, would be enormous. A transformation would require “incredible incentives” that city leadership might not support, she said.\nThe Farmers Branch building that’s home to an IRS office might be the most straightforward property from a marketing perspective, said Marcus &amp; Millichap veteran Ron Hebert. It’s a land play.\nIf the building at\n4050 Alpha Road\nwas torn down, the 9.44-acre plot would be “a great size for multifamily,” he said. The suburb’s school district is more desirable to Dallas’, he added, and that community would be more likely to tolerate rezoning.\n\n“You’d look out and see the stadium and the Green Belt. You could go walk around the college. It’s not a bad location,” he said.\nWhile it sits on a much smaller plot — 2.87 acres — the A. Maceo Smith Federal Building could also be a land play, Ragan said. The 189,000-square-foot office building at 525 South Griffin Street was built in 1971 and last renovated almost 15 years ago.\nBut its proximity to the convention center is a bonus, she said.\nIt could also work for an owner-user like a charter school or nonprofit organization, Partners’ Steve Triolet said.\nThe Terminal Annex, another mid-size property on the list, could also have a second life as an updated office building, Triolet said. Ragan pointed out that parking is bad at the location, and it’s on the National Registry of Historic Places, so it can’t be easily torn down.\nWhile downtown Fort Worth’s Fritz G. Lanham Federal Building has the benefit of a desirable location, its massive size and layout might make it an albatross of a development project.\nIt could be suitable for a multi-tenant conversion or repurposed into a mixed-use office space, Triolet said.\nRegardless of the fate of these properties, Ragan worries they’ll mess with comps if the government opts for a fire sale.\n“That is going to come up for conversation for everything else that is out there on the market,” she said.\n",

    "content": "New allegations tied to a mortgage fraud scandal that rocked the industry and landed an executive in federal prison now implicate JPMorgan, the lender on the deal, and the borrower — New York’s Chetrit Group.\nWells Fargo, which filed suit in federal civil court as trustee on a $481 million CMBS loan, alleges JPMorgan knew the mortgage it made to\nChetrit\nfor a national multifamily portfolio was based on inflated financials. But it doled out the debt anyway.\nThe suit — first reported by Reuters — also alleges that the Chetrit Group was aware that the numbers had been fudged by the seller Roco Real Estate.\nRoco and the 43-property deal have been central to a widening federal investigation into\nmortgage fraud\n. In 2023, Roco principal\nTyler Ross\npleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to commit an offense against the United States related to a previous financing of the properties. He was sentenced to a year in federal prison in September.\nThe Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency have uncovered that in multiple deals, operators routinely manipulated property financials such as expenses to obtain larger loans from lenders than they would have otherwise secured.\nSo far, at least six real estate operators across the U.S. have pleaded guilty. The investigation is ongoing.\nWells Fargo’s filing marks the first major lawsuit against a lender in the broader commercial mortgage fraud scandal. Lenders have largely claimed to be victims of borrowers’ fraud.\nJPMorgan declined to comment on the lawsuit, as did an attorney for Wells Fargo.\nChetrit, through a spokesperson, pointed the finger at Roco, calling itself “a victim of seller fraud, which was investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice.”\n“Financial misrepresentations were made by the seller that we unknowingly relied upon when we purchased the property,” said a Chetrit representative in a statement.\n“We suffered great financial loss due to the seller’s fraud,” the spokesperson said. “As a result of the fraud, the seller was convicted.”\nThe saga dates back to 2019 when Chetrit was shopping for debt to buy Roco’s apartment deal. Through due diligence, it allegedly found Roco had falsified trailing 12 month financial statements, notably inflating net operating income by 25 percent.\n\nChetrit found $3.5 million in reported income did not exist and $2.6 million in repair costs and expenses were missing, according to the lawsuit. It allegedly flagged the errors to Roco and the seller fessed up to the flubs, agreeing to slash the sale price by over $65 million.\nThe Chetrits then brought the fraudulent financials to JPMorgan’s attention.\nInternally, the lender acknowledged the reporting was unreliable, according to the complaint. An analyst handling due diligence on the deal texted a colleague that the financial statements were “‘made up’” and “‘ridic[ulous],’” the suit details.\nUltimately, the 10,000-unit portfolio traded for $522 million, the suit states. The deal was risky — a $481 million loan on a $522 million acquisition shakes out to an incredible 92 percent loan-to-value ratio. But JPMorgan knew it would insulate itself from problems by immediately securitizing the deal, and pocket millions of dollars in fees to boot, according to the lawsuit.\nJPMorgan “was willing to issue such a risky loan because it never intended to hold it,” the suit said. Rather, the risk would be passed on to the deal’s unwitting bondholders, who now face tens of millions of dollars in losses, the suit alleges.\nWells Fargo argues JPMorgan “had an obligation” to validate whether the figures were accurate.\nChetrit defaulted on the debt in 2022 after the deals failed to generate sufficient cash flow to\nservice the loan\n. In early 2023, a spokesperson for the firm said it was looking to sell assets to right the ship.\nThe firm nabbed a temporary forbearance agreement in June 2023 but defaulted on the terms just a few months later, according to Morningstar Credit. A receiver was appointed in February 2024 and the past year has seen a spate of foreclosures: four Texas properties, three in Alabama, seven in Mississippi, according to Morningstar.\nPre-foreclosure filings in Florida, Ohio, Arkansas and Louisiana are pending, as of last month.\nMeanwhile, the Wells Fargo suit seeks to hold Meyer Chetrit, the guarantor on the debt, personally liable for the potential tens of millions in losses to the trust.\nThe trustee demands JPMorgan either repurchase the loan or pay damages to cover the trust’s losses.\n",

    "content": "Lafayette, a city of $2 million homes, has played a shell game with state housing regulators to avoid building its share of affordable housing.\nThat’s the contention of the Housing Action Coalition, a San Francisco-based housing advocate that is suing the East Bay city for creating “misleading and unrealistic housing sites” to satisfy state-mandated housing goals,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported\n.\nThe lawsuit seeks a court to compel the city to adopt a revised plan with an update to its zoning laws. The city must rezone to build 2,114 homes, 943 of them affordable, by 2031.\nThe coalition accuses the city of “pretending” to comply with the planning blueprint, known as the housing element, required of every city and county across the state every eight years.\nLafayette’s alleged shell game includes relying on faith-based institutions and longtime businesses with no plans to develop housing as potential building sites for homes, according to the complaint filed by Farella Braun and Martel a San Francisco-based law firm.\nIn one case, the city said a CVS will be torn down and rebuilt into 26 homes — but CVS has a long-term lease, with no intention of moving, according to the lawsuit. Other examples were not disclosed.\n“We hoped that Lafayette would take its responsibility to plan for housing seriously, but instead, they passed a housing element that deliberately ignores the facts,” Ali Sapirman, the advocacy and policy manager with the Housing Action Coalition, told the Chronicle. “Lafayette is continuing a pattern of obstruction, using questionable calculations to block much-needed housing while pretending to comply with state law.\n“The housing crisis is severe, and every city, including Lafayette, must do its fair share,” Sapirman added.\n\nIn its housing plan, Lafayette proposed using city-owned parking lots for housing, as well as sites downtown and at religious institutions to build affordable housing. The city projects that 27 accessory dwelling units will be built each year, for a total of 216 units.\nOfficials also said more than 150 units were under construction, with another 570 approved units in the development pipeline.\nThe city didn’t immediately return a request for comment by the newspaper.\nLafayette was once a battleground for the region’s housing wars, with two lawsuits, a ballot referendum and more than 100 public hearings that delayed a 315-unit apartment building for almost a dozen years.\nLast year, the\nstate Supreme Court declined\nto hear an appeal from a neighborhood group attempting to stop the development, allowing it to move forward. The project has not broken ground.\nWithin a 10-year span, 115 homes were built in the city of 25,000 residents, including 10 in 2010, 76 in 2018 and 29 in 2019 — according to its housing element plan.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "A lender is going toe-to-toe with Don King, alleging the Donald Trump loving boxing promoter defaulted on a $5.3 million mortgage.\nAn affiliate of Miami-based Blueprint Capital Partners filed a foreclosure complaint in Broward County Circuit Court against King and his entity Fairway Enterprises that owns a 46,467-square-foot warehouse at 501 Fairway Drive in\nDeerfield Beach\n, court records and real estate database Vizzda show. Blueprint Capital alleges that King stopped making interest-only payments in August.\nKing did not respond to requests for comment.\n“I don’t care if you’re Don King or Mike Tyson, if you don’t pay your obligations, you’re going to get sued,” said David Haber, Blueprint Capital’s attorney. “In this case, they weren’t met and we had to file a foreclosure action.”\n\nFairway purchased the 4.4-acre industrial property for $3 million in 2000, records show. The building was completed in 1985. Two years ago, the entity obtained a $5.1 million loan from a previous lender that was increased by $200,000 in 2024 and personally guaranteed by King, the complaint states. Also last year, Blueprint Capital acquired the mortgage.\nA Boca Raton homeowner, the 93-year-old sports icon is among the 45th and 47th president’s most famous supporters. In a December Instagram post, King declared\nTrump\nwas “God sent; and people chosen, made the greatest political comeback in the history of America!!” Recently, King posted a selfie photo of himself wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat alongside\nElon Musk\n, the world’s richest man who is leading DOGE, or the Department of Government Efficiency.\nDOGE\nis charged with dumping federally-owned real estate as part of its nationwide purge of government assets, employees and programs.\nFound guilty of second-degree murder in 1967 and sentenced to 20 years in prison, King was released from prison three years later when his conviction was reduced to manslaughter. He rose to boxing prominence promoting and arranging some of the sport’s most famous fights featuring the late Muhammad Ali, considered the greatest boxing champion of all time. King also managed and promoted George Foreman, Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield and Roy Jones Jr., among other world champs.\nA longtime Palm Beach County resident, King owns a former\nJai Alai fronton\nin Mangonia Park that he tried to sell in the mid-2010s to a potential buyer that proposed redeveloping the site into a mixed-use project featuring a sports facility, retail stores, restaurants, a hotel and vocational and charter schools.

    "content": "Frontline Realty Capital has a pending deal to buy a 138,400-square-foot office building in San Francisco’s Bayside Village for around $30 million, nearly half its last traded price.\nThe locally based investor is moving to buy the four-story brick building at 625 Second Street, in Bayside Village west of the Embarcadero,\nthe San Francisco Business Times reported\n, citing an unidentified source. The seller is Hudson Pacific Properties, based in Los Angeles.\nThe real estate investment trust listed the 119-year-old brick and timber building last year, seeking between $200 and $250 per square foot, or between $27.7 million and $34.6 million.\nFinancial terms of the pending deal between Frontline and Hudson Pacific were not disclosed. But a source told the Business Times a Frontline purchase would “track” near the listed price.\nHudson Pacific bought the building in 2011 for $56.4 million, or $408 per square foot.\nThe Class A building, built in 1906 and renovated in 1999, has exposed timber beams and brick walls, and has the original arched brick doorways and metal sliding fire doors, according to KBS.\nThe building is now 38.7 percent leased, or more than 60 percent vacant.\n\nA deal would mark the second purchase for Frontline this year. In January, the firm snapped up an 91,000-square foot building in a lender sale at 1440 Broadway in downtown Oakland for\n$5.5 million, or $60 per square foot\n, 86 percent less than its previous sale.\nFrontline founder Rob Mann described 1440 Broadway as the type of building he wanted to acquire more of: a well-located asset “with significant potential to create value through thoughtful repositioning and patience.”\nFrontline Realty Capital, founded in 2016, invests in industrial, retail and office properties in the Bay Area, Inland Empire and select western markets, according to its website.\nHudson Pacific Properties, founded in 2009 by Victor Coleman, owns 2.4 million square feet of property in San Francisco, after a buying spree in the early 2010s, according to a regulatory filing. It’s selling\nfour office buildings for up to $150 million\nas it struggles with hundreds of millions in financial losses.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Green Brick owns five subsidiary homebuilders in Texas, including CB JENI Homes, Normandy Homes, Southgate Homes and a 90 percent interest in Centre Living Homes, according to its website.\n\nThe acquisition follows Green Brick’s September purchase of 557 acres along FM 1385 in northern Denton County, where it plans to build 2,200 homes near Pilot Point. The company cited the extension of the Dallas North Tollway to G.A. Moore Parkway as a factor in the area’s growing appeal to homebuyers.\nPrices are expected to start below $400,000. In February, the median home price in Denton County was about $480,000, in Cooke County it was $400,000 and in Grayson County it was $350,000, according to Realtor.com.\nFrom mid-2020 to mid-2023, the population in Denton County jumped 11.2 percent, increased 5.1 percent in Cooke County and 8.4 percent in Grayson County, census data shows.\nDenton County’s population surpassed 1 million in 2023, with nearly 30,000 new residents in a single year.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "A prominent real estate developer may be preparing to enter the race to be the next mayor of Boston.\nThomas O’Brien, managing partner of HYM Investment Group, is weighing a bid to supplant Michelle Wu at the top of the city’s political ranks, the Boston Globe\nreported\n. O’Brien has not officially announced a campaign for the election, which will take place in November.\nO’Brien would likely run as a Democrat. The top two vote-getters for mayor in preliminary voting in September would battle in a runoff two months later.\n“It is clear some developers are willing to do whatever it takes to buy this office,” read a statement from the Wu reelection campaign.“It seems like Josh Kraft is not turning out to be what they expected and now they are shopping for a new option.”\nResidents and business leaders have called O’Brien to express concern about fiscal health, rising property taxes, affordable housing and the quality of the city’s public school system. The commercial real estate community has lately grown frustrated with Wu, particularly her attempts to\nraise commercial property tax rates\nwhile capping rent hikes for residences.\nO’Brien has a number of important real estate developments in the works with HYM. The firm is spearheading the redevelopment of Suffolk Downs and the Government Center Garage. The firm also won the bid to develop a parcel in Roxbury into a life sciences hub and housing.\n\nProminent projects for HYM, which launched in 2009, also include Boston Landing in Brighton, NorthPoint in Cambridge and Bulfinch Crossing in downtown Boston.\nO’Brien — brother of Boston College football coach Bill O’Brien — served the city for five years at the city planning and development agency under Thomas Menino in the 1990s. He resigned after a scandal erupted over a senior agency aide buying a subsidized condo intended for low-income families.\nAnother candidate with a football connection, Josh Kraft — son of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft —\nlaunched his campaign\nlast month. The philanthropist is honing in on rent control and more affordable housing while distancing from his father’s ties to Donald Trump.\nWu will be difficult to beat in the fall, as no incumbent mayor in the city has lost a re-election campaign in more than 75 years.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Even “desolate.”\nThen came a\nflood\nof new restaurants, coffee shops and stores, filling the streets with people.\nWith increased popularity, landlords also have boosted rents.\nSouthern Land’s project site\nused to be mostly vacant land, with a shuttered commercial building that had broken windows, graffiti and homeless sleepers.\nThe company is now building three seven-story buildings there with a two-story fitness center, a rooftop deck and 8,600 square feet of ground-floor shops and restaurants. The firm expects to open early next year, according to Southern Land development manager Alex Woodin.\n\nWoodin said his firm began looking at the Arts District four years ago, noting its walkability.\n“It felt good, it felt right,” he told the Review-Journal.\nCedar Street Companies and Bridge Investment Group have also broken ground, and have said they expect to open by next summer. The seven-story complex will include a large fitness center, a resort-style spa, including saunas, and ground-floor shops and restaurants.\nSouthern Land, founded in 1986 by Tim Downey, has built apartments and homes from New York to Nevada, according to its website.\nCedar Street Companies, founded in 2009 by Alex Samoylovich, Will Murphy and Mark Heffron, has $4 billion in assets under management, including 7,500 apartments across numerous markets, including Chicago, San Diego, Portland, Minneapolis and Cleveland, according to a release.\nBridge Investment Group, an alternative investment firm founded in 2009, had $49.4 billion of assets under management as of September 2023. The firm went public in 2021.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Jackson-Shaw Chairman Lewis W. Shaw, who built a small Dallas firm into a real estate development titan, has died. He was 82.\nShaw was raised in Dayton, Ohio, and graduated from Wittenberg University in Springfield before serving in the United States Air Force, where he was a cryptologist and flight instructor. He arrived in Dallas to work for IBM in 1974.\n“I’d always wanted to be a Texan,” he told the Dallas Morning News in 2004. His father was an orphan, raised in the Buckner Children’s Home in Dallas, and was killed at a railroad crossing when Shaw was 4. As a child, Shaw spent summers with an uncle in Aransas Pass.\nShaw met Jim Jackson at Addison Airport when Jackson asked Shaw to give him aerobatic lessons, and Jackson hired Shaw as a salesman at his four-person real estate firm Jackson Companies. Shaw took over the company after Jackson died in a plane crash in 1976 and renamed it two years later.\nUnder Shaw’s leadership, Jackson-Shaw developed more than 63 million square feet of industrial and hospitality real estate nationwide, including hotels in Las Vegas, Phoenix and Fort Worth, as well as nondescript low-rise office and industrial buildings tucked into major cities.\nHe was known for financing his own projects and hanging onto assets the firm developed rather than selling them off.\n“I don’t build with somebody else’s MasterCard,” Shaw told the Dallas Morning News in 2004. “My first priority is who will pay the rent, not who will buy the project. It’s cash flow, not cashing out.”\nPart of his development strategy for light industrial development was to find land that nobody wanted.\n\n“I don’t want to join the crowd. I want to get there before it assembles. Proof of low demand for me is proof of opportunity,” he said in 2004.\nShaw co-founded American General Hospitality in 1980. Its portfolio fell into distress after the global stock markets crash of 1987, and lenders took nine of its properties, but Shaw continued to manage them.\nThe hospitality company became a publicly traded REIT in 1996 and later merged with Meristar REIT and Interstate Hotels &amp; Resorts.\nShaw was known as a reader and a music lover who had a casual style of dressing and a contrarian spirit.\n“Lewis is a lone wolf avoiding the herd mentality yet fiercely loyal to his friends and partners,” NAI Global Chairman Tom Lynn said in 2004.\nA list of survivors wasn’t immediately available.\nShaw was inducted into the North Texas Commercial Association of Realtors Hall of Fame in 2003. He also served on the Wittenberg University Board of Directors and was actively involved in numerous civic and national organizations. A dedicated aviator, he had a lifelong passion for flying and traveled extensively in his own aircraft.\n",

    "content": "A man who authorities say played a key role in a multimillion-dollar\nmortgage fraud\nscheme in Florida was arraigned on Tuesday morning after he was extradited to the U.S. from Nigeria.\nOkechukwu Josiah Odunna, a resident of Abuja, Nigeria, was charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution, for his alleged role in an $8 million plot that involved 20 residential properties in Florida, including homes in Miami Shores and North Miami Beach, court records show. Each count carries up to a 30-year prison sentence. Others involved included former North Miami Mayor\nMarie Lucie Tondreau\n.\nBetween 2005 and 2008, Odunna, then a licensed attorney, and his co-conspirators allegedly submitted fraudulent loan applications to banks and other financial institutions that resulted in lenders handing out more money than they otherwise would, according to the United States Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of Florida. The applications included fake names of borrowers, inflated sale prices and false information about the funds.\n\nOdunna was a settlement agent in about 20 allegedly fraudulent closings. The properties included the homes at 9906 North Miami Avenue in\nMiami Shores\n, 216 Northwest 100th Street in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, and 16325 Northeast Sixth Avenue in\nNorth Miami Beach\n, according to the indictment.\nThe indictment was filed in 2014, but Odunna was only arrested a decade later, in September of last year, by Nigerian authorities. He was transported to the U.S. last week and had his first appearance before a judge on March 6.\nThe alleged scheme also involved Karl Oreste, Tondreau and Kelly Augustin. Oreste was sentenced to more than eight years in prison, but granted a compassionate release in 2020. He owes over $8 million in restitution. Tondreau, the former mayor, was convicted by a jury trial in late 2014 and sentenced to more than five years in prison. She recruited straw buyers for the deals alongside Agustin, according to the indictment. Augustin is still a fugitive.\n",

    "content": "Multifamily landlords have the upper hand over Chicago renters, and that’s not likely to change for years as apartment leasing prices are set to soar amid a cliffdrop for development.\nThe city’s downtown apartment market reached new heights last year, when the average unit within a group of 84 buildings tracked by Luxury Living surpassed $3,000 for the first time ever, according to the multifamily brokerage and consultant. The mean figure landed at $3,077, up 28 percent from 2023, with units in the Streeterville neighborhood — which holds the largest average floorplans of downtown areas — commanding the most-expensive average rent at $3,648.\nLandlords and their leasing teams pushed prices to the new milestone despite smaller units — studios and convertibles, in particular — making up a larger share of deals last year, Luxury Living found.\n“Knowing how minimal the new supply pipeline is, it’s easy to see demand will continue to go up. Retention will be high,” said Aaron Galvin, Luxury Living’s founder and a developer of the Saint Grand, a 248-unit tower in Streeterville that was being leased last year after opening to residents.\nLease signings increased 33 percent last year within the buildings studied, up to 14,086 from 10,600 in 2023. But there’s little carryover of new, move-in ready units into this year. In fact, only about 500 units are expected to come online this year, down from the 10-year average of more than 3,500 units, according to Integra Realty Resources. Historically low vacancy rates are the anticipated result.\n“Rents are expected to spike in 2025,” Integra said in its outlook.\nThe next two years aren’t so promising for renters, either, as developers are constrained by tight capital markets, rising construction costs and, most recently, increased uncertainty over material costs as President Trump threatens major trading partners with tariffs.\n\n“Developers indicate virtually every deal remains in a holding pattern until at least mid-2025,” Integra said, noting that the next wave of deliveries won’t occur until 2027 at the earliest.\nBehind Streeterville, the next-priciest downtown Chicago submarkets are River North, Gold Coast/Old Town and the West Loop/Fulton Market, which are the only others with average unit rents in excess of $3,000. The Loop was the only neighborhood where renters might have caught a break last year, with the average lease signed decreasing slightly to $2,848, down from $2,872 in 2023, Luxury Living found. The South Loop and River West respectively trailed those neighborhoods.\nFurthermore, the average unit size stayed fairly flat last year, at 781 square feet, up from 777 in 2023, but tenants opted far more often for studio and convertible units, forsaking the extra space offered by one-bedroom layouts in exchange for a break on cost, Galvin said. Rents per square foot were up 2.1 percent to $3.94 last year.\n“That’s coming down to attainability in terms of income that we’re seeing in the market,” Galvin said. ​​”There are just that many more people making enough money to qualify for studios and convertibles, as compared to one-beds.”\nRenters of smaller units are also less likely to need parking, he said, which developers are noting as they plot their return to the market from the slowdown.\n“When you’re looking at construction costs and how to get the development pipeline turned on again, less parking is likely to be more of a trend moving forward,” Galvin said.\nEditor’s note: This story was updated to correct the rents per square foot figure.\n",

In addition to the money needed upfront to acquire the surplus of goods, builders also need to pay for places to store the excess materials.\nWhile Trump aired tariffs ahead of his election victory in November, his broadside promises have grown more uncertain in recent weeks.\n“I can’t keep ping ponging back and forth,” Idaho-based Steve Martinez told the Journal after Trump’s latest pause on select tariffs implemented against Canada and Mexico.\nLumber is among the items affected; more than 70 percent of imported softwood lumber comes from the two countries, according to the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nTariffs aren’t the only challenge facing builders under Trump. Contractors are also facing the potential loss of immigrant labor due to the administration’s hardline stance on illegal immigration and steady stream of deportation threats.\nIf or when the tariffs do land, the extra costs will likely result in ballooning home prices. The NAHB estimates the costs of building a single-family home could increase by $7,500 to $10,000.\nBuilders anticipated the tough times ahead under Trump’s second term, with reports of stockpiling materials surfacing\nshortly after the election\n. But a drop in consumer demand for new homes could leave builders paying to store materials they can’t use.\nOther builders are exploring materials that can be sourced in the United States, constructing smaller homes or taking a stab at modular construction. Builders are also pursuing incentives to reel in buyers, such as mortgage buydowns and cash discounts.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "Austin’s high-end condo market got a jolt last week, with two condos over $2 million going under contract and six more landing on the market.\nTwelve homes listed for over $2 million went under contract last week in Austin, along with 10 single-family homes and two condos, according to the Eklund Gomes luxury report.\nOne of the condos, at the Austonian, was listed for $2.3 million, and the other for $2.2 million at an eight-townhome complex at 706 West Avenue.\nUnit 38SW at the Austonian, at 200 Congress Ave, spans 1,800 square feet, asking about $1,290 per square foot. It has two bedrooms and a study and comes with two parking spaces, a storage unit and electric car charger. Betty Epperson of Epperson Realty Group had the listing.\nUnit H at 706 West Avenue in downtown was recently renovated and has three bedrooms. It spans 2,200 square feet, asking $1,000 per square foot, with a private two-car garage. Moreland Properties agent Monica Painter had the listing.\nThe highest-priced active condo listing came online on March 10, asking $4.25 million, unit at The Colorfield at 1006 Baylor Street. Unit 303 is one of 10 residences in the building, spanning almost 3,000 square feet with three bedrooms. Unit 202 also hit the market the same day asking for $3.75 million. Moreland Properties is selling all units at the development.\nAustin developer Cumby Group will open its four-story The Colorfield development this summer, according to its website. Its penthouse unit is listed for $9 million.\n\nThe majority of the single-family homes under contract were centered around Tarrytown and West Lake Hills, with a few exceptions.\nLast listed at $3.8 million, the top contract was signed for a home at 16001 Pontevedra Place in the Barton Creek Bluffs neighborhood in Bee Cave. It spans 6,000 square feet on 1 acre, asking about $630 per square foot, with two stories and six bedrooms plus a media room, two game rooms, a pool and sports court. Thomas Stone from Stone Properties has the listing.\nAlso outside the usual high-end neighborhoods where multi-million dollar homes sell, the lowest-priced deal of the bunch was for a $2.4 million new home near Bear Creek, listed by Clay Lake of Keeping It Realty. It spans 4,260 square feet on over 2 acres, asking about $565 per square foot.\nThe second priciest deal was for a home asking $3.3 million in Tarrytown. At 3600 Taylors Drive, the four bedroom, 3,000-square-foot home comes with an office and a pool on a third of an acre. It asked for about $1,085 per square foot and was listed by Megan DeLeeuw Cavazos of Gottesman Residential Real Estate.\nMore contracts were signed last week than\nthe week before\n, from 10 to 12, but total sales volume dropped $2.3 million to $34.1 million.\nThe single-family homes had an average of $721 per square foot and their average days on market increased slightly to 68 from 63 days, the report said. The two condos had an average of $1,144 per square foot and 185 days on market.\n",

    "content": "Developer James Curnin and his wife Jennifer spent four years building their waterfront La Gorce Island mansion in Miami Beach. Last week, they sold the property for $60 million.\nThe Curnins sold the 9,640-square-foot home at 66 La Gorce Circle to a land trust named after the address, records show. The 0.4-acre property faces north, overlooking Normandy Isle.\n“Brokers were obviously constantly reaching out. It was never really intended to be for sale,” said James Curnin, founder and CEO of\nClara Homes\n, calling it a “really tough decision” to sell the house. It was completed in late August and his family had moved in by September.\nMax Strang designed the house, and New York-based Pembrooke &amp; Ives handled the interior design and furnishings. The property was sold in an off-market deal that included most of the furniture, Curnin said. He declined to identify the buyer.\nJordan Karp brokered the sale.\nClara Homes\npaid $7.5 million\nfor the property in 2020 and had the previous house demolished, records show. It was later transferred into the Curnins’ names.\n\nOn the\nsame island\n, consumer goods multimillionaire Anand Khubani\npaid $100 million\nin September for the properties at 18, 22 and 24 La Gorce Circle, where he plans a massive estate.\nLast year, Curnin’s Clara Homes sold an unfinished waterfront spec house on the Venetian Islands to Long Light Capital’s Justin Korsant for $23.1 million. Clara Homes also has projects in Miami’s Wynwood and Bay Harbor Islands.\nThe Curnins’ most recent sale on La Gorce Island adds to a string of recent big-ticket deals in Miami Beach and across South Florida.\nLate last month, billionaire developer\nVlad Doronin\nsold his waterfront Star Island estate for $120 million, setting a new record for home sales in Miami-Dade County. Doronin’s Garden Islands International LLC sold the 2.5-acre property at 26 Star Island Drive in Miami Beach to Constellation Drive LLC, a Delaware entity led by businessman Michael Ferro.\nAbout the same time, gaming entrepreneur Richard Skelhorn\npaid $45 million\nfor the waterfront mansion at 40 Palm Avenue in Miami Beach, setting a record for Palm Island.\n",

    "content": "Greenpoint Landing seems to be expanding.\nPark Tower Group filed plans for three additional buildings in the Brooklyn community, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The three parcels are within the 22-acre riverfront development in Greenpoint.\nThe listed owner in all three building applications was Park Tower Group chief operating officer Anne Carson Blair. The building filings were first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\nThe largest of the three filings was at 21 Freeman Street. Gary Handel of Handel Architects submitted a plan for a 40-story, 400,000-square-foot building with 503 residential units. Handel also filed plans for a 30-story, 220,000-square-foot building with 298 units at 37 Freeman Street and for a nine-story, 172,000-square-foot building with 224 units at 209 West Street.\nCombined, the properties comprise 1,025 additional housing units for Greenpoint Landing across nearly 800,000 square feet. Park Tower declined to comment to the Observer.\n\nThe 11-building, 5,500-unit master-planned Greenpoint Landing — situated near where the East River meets Newton Creek — has been in the works for decades; the first phase of construction commenced in 2014. The project includes 1,400 affordable housing units and five acres of open space for the public.\nThe most recent addition to Greenpoint Landing came at 16 Dupont Street, a 41-story tower developed alongside Rockefeller Group that opened last year. The partners secured\na $200 million construction loan\nfrom Japan-based Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank to finance the project in 2022.\nBrookfield Properties is also a partner on numerous buildings within Greenpoint Landing. Most of the residential properties in Greenpoint Landing are rentals, though condominiums are becoming\nincreasingly attractive\nin the Brooklyn neighborhood.\nElsewhere in Greenpoint, logistics company Prologis started the year by acquiring the 10-acre site at 440 Kingsland Avenue from ExxonMobil\nfor $122 million\n. A logistics facility or vehicle storage hub are among the possibilities raised for the parcel.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The total contract volume was $80.8 million.\nDuring the same week last year, there were 16 contracts signed for $50 million.\nThe priciest deal last week belonged to 297 Pacific Street in Boerum Hill, which last asked $8.5 million.\nThe 25-foot-wide carriage house initially hit the market at the start of last year, asking $12 million before dropping the price almost 30 percent in June.\nThe nearly 5,700-square-foot home has five bedrooms, four bathrooms and private parking. The four-story house has two wings that flank a 920-square-foot Great Room on the first floor with a 20-foot overhead skylight and stone wood-burning fireplace.\nThe second floor has a private terrace, while the third floor has a primary suite with two walk-in closets and access to a private fourth-floor study and terrace.\n\nCorcoran’s Lesley Semmelhack had the listing.\nThe second most expensive contract was a single-family home at 1135 84th Street in Dyker Heights asking $4.3 million.\nSpanning over 5,000 interior square feet, the first floor of the seven-bedroom manse has ceilings over 10 feet high and custom wood molding and trimmings, seven wood-burning fireplaces and stained glass windows, as well as a den that leads out onto a front porch.\nThe property sits on an 8,000-square-foot lot, also home to a detached two-car garage.\nDanielle Jabour of Jabour Realty Company had the listing.\nIt was the third straight week that contract numbers have trended up in the Brooklyn luxury market — three weeks ago there were 16 contracts signed for $43.3 million in asking volume, and two weeks ago 25 contracts signed for $75.7 million.\nThe average price per square foot in the most recent period was $1,471 and the average discount was 3 percent.\n",

    "content": "The Pérez family’s Related Group proposes a 390-unit Live Local Act project for the second phase of its redevelopment of a South Miami public housing complex.\nThe application comes as the Coconut Grove-based firm has seized on the state law that incentivizes development of apartments at affordable and workforce rents, with a flurry of new proposals.\nRelated wants to build an 11-story building with 8,700 square feet of retail and 501 parking spaces on a 3.3-acre site at 5949 Southwest 68th Street, according to the company’s application filed to Miami-Dade County last week. The project, called Gallery at SoMi Parc, would consist of one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments.\nRelated is asking the county for a pre-application meeting to discuss building the project under the Live Local Act and Miami-Dade’s Rapid Transit System-Development Zone — SMART Corridor Subzone, a regulation that gives wiggle room for development due to a site’s proximity to a public transportation station or major road. Pre-application meetings are generally requested before a developer files an official proposal.\nGallery at SoMi Parc marks the second phase of Related’s redevelopment of a 6.2-acre county-owned site that was home to South Miami Gardens Apartments public housing complex. The project’s first phase is the 172-unit Residences at SoMi Parc mixed-income building that opened last year at 5961 Southwest 68th Street, adjacent to the Gallery at SoMi Parc development site.\nIn 2020, Miami-Dade sought a request for proposals to redevelop the 58-unit South Miami Gardens Apartments complex and selected Related’s affordable housing arm, Related Urban Development Group, later that year, according to a 2022 county commission meeting agenda item when the development agreement was approved. Under the agreement, 58 units at Residences at SoMi Parc replaced the 58 public housing units lost in the South Miami Gardens Apartments redevelopment.\n\nRelated Urban signed a 75-year ground lease with the county for the Residences at SoMi Parc in 2022, according to records. It is expected that Related Urban will sign a similar ground lease for the Gallery at SoMi Parc site after securing project financing, the 2022 agenda item says. The county will receive a total of $101.7 million in payments over the term of the development agreement.\nRelated\n–– led by patriarch\nJorge Pérez\nand his sons Jon Paul and Nicholas Pérez –– has ramped up its development pipeline. The firm for years partnered with the county to redevelop public housing, and in recent months has seized on\nLive Local Act\nfor some of these projects.\nUnder the state law, approved in 2023, developers can build bigger projects than a site’s zoning allows, as long as at least 40 percent of apartments are for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income. The law also provides tax breaks and a reprieve on floor area ratio and parking requirements.\nIn Miami’s Little Havana, Related wants to supersize the 1,379-unit Haley Sofge public housing complex with a\n1,038-unit Live Local Act project\nin a pair of 21-story towers and a 12-story building. The site is at  800 Northwest 13th Avenue, 780 Northwest 13th Court and 1389 Northwest Seventh Street.\nIn Miami’s Health District, Related wants to replace the Claude Pepper age-restricted public housing building with a\n398-unit Live Local project\nwhere all units will be at below-market rents. The site is at 750 Northwest 18th Terrace.\nThis month, Related, New York-based LeFrak Organization and Coconut Grove-based 13th Floor Investments purchased a 2.5-acre development site 3650 Bird Road in Miami for\n$35 million\n. The property has approvals for two 40-story towers with 748 apartments and 20,000 square feet of retail.",

    "content": "A suburban residential development’s future may hinge on negotiations as much as planning.\nThe Wirtz family, owners of the Chicago Blackhawks and Breakthru Beverage Group, has reopened talks with local school districts over impact fees tied to its massive Ivanhoe Village development, Crain’s\nreported\n.\nThe renewed talks follow\nescalating tensions\nbetween the Wirtz Realty Corporation, Mundelein officials and two school districts over how much the developer should pay to offset the project’s impact on public services.\nThe districts say the development could bring as many as 1,000 new students to the schools over 25 years and cost an estimated $150 million for new facilities.\nRepresentatives for the Wirtzes halted the talks in January.\nThe Mundelein Village Board pulled two agenda items from its meeting this week — one on the proposed fee terms and the second an ordinance on codifying a formula for calculating the fees — to allow for further negotiations.\n\nThe village board’s review of Wirtz’s proposed impact fee contributions, originally scheduled for March 11, was also postponed.\nIvanhoe Village, a 3,600-home development planned over 740 acres, is expected to take 20 to 25 years. The impact fees are meant to help districts fund expansions and improvements to accommodate the growth.\nNegotiations stalled over a massive gap in expectations. Fremont School District 79 is seeking $50 million from Wirtz to help fund a new $150 million elementary school, while Wirtz’s legal team has countered with an estimate closer to $5 million.\nIn recent weeks, tensions have spilled into the public. School officials accused the village of sidelining them during negotiations and criticized Wirtz for underestimating the project’s potential strain on schools.\nMundelein Mayor Steve Lentz responded by accusing the districts of trying to “embarrass” the high-profile Wirtz family into paying more than what Illinois law requires. Lentz also emphasized that municipalities, not school districts, are responsible for negotiating impact fees.\n",

    "content": "Related California plans to build a 41-story office building and hotel in San Francisco while nearly two out of five city workplaces sit empty.\nFor the Irvine-based developer, it’s all in how you crunch the numbers for the proposed office-hotel tower at 530 Sansome Street, in the North Financial District across from the Transamerica Pyramid near Jackson Square,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nYes, overall office vacancy across the city hovers at a dismal 37 percent.  Yes, the top five buildings have a 16 percent vacancy.\nBut when you pull away the drapes, the city’s true office trophies with views from the Golden Gate to the Bay Bridge command a vacancy of 6.9 percent — the target for the Related venture.\n“Right building in the right location at the right time,” Matt Witte, executive vice president of acquisitions and development for Related California, told the Chronicle.\n“This started out as a contrarian bet but as we dug in deeper and looked at the market, how it is evolving and maturing out of COVID, it doesn’t seem so contrarian any more,” added Gino Canori, president of Related California. “It’s a story about San Francisco’s recovery, about the city coming out of a tough time and building something everyone can be proud of.”\nPlans call for a 544-foot tower with 360,000 square feet of offices atop a five-star, 200-room hotel, plus a new firehouse at 447 Battery Street to replace a station swallowed up by the project. A previous 19-story hotel and fitness club project, approved in 2021, stalled.\nThe city is expected to publish an environmental study on Tuesday, March 11. Related hopes to secure approvals to build the tower this fall, allowing the firm to break ground by late next year. If all goes well, the gleaming glass rectangle could be completed by 2030.\nIt would be the first new North Financial District building since 350 Bush Street opened in 2018, and the first new five-star hotel in 30 years, according to the Chronicle. It’s expected to cost\n$600 million\n.\n\nThe tower, designed by Chicago-based SOM, would anchor a block across from the Transamerica Pyramid, which New York-based Michael Shvo revamped, investing $1 billion. Rents for top-floor offices in the area are north of $200 a square foot, more than three times the city average.\nIt would also be built next to Jackson Square — the hot spot in San Francisco’s glacial rebound.\nRelated California, a unit of New York-based Related Companies, “did a lot of homework,” touring buildings and digging into leasing data, Canori said.\nAs it hoovered up information, it grew convinced there was demand for a new building with “killer views” and features that top tenants want  — meeting rooms and workout facilities and outside terraces and swank restaurants.\nSuch amenities not only help recruit and retain talent. They attract them to a return-to-office.\nThree North Financial District tenants have leases expiring in 2030 who are “taking a very close look” at the proposed building, Canori told the newspaper, which “is further emboldening our ability to press ahead with getting the project approved and started.\n“We think the market is there,” he declared.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Pretium carved out a niche as a major player in the single-family rental space. It’s looking to expand its reach into affordable housing.\nDon Mullen’s investment manager is\nraising money\nearmarked for acquiring single-family homes that can be rented affordably, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. It would be the first time Pretium is raising a fund for the category.\nThe $60 billion asset manager plans to acquire properties, renovate them extensively and rent them out to those with Section 8 housing vouchers. The program subsidizes rents for those earning 50 percent or less of the area median income.\nMore than 2.3 million households are in the federal program; Pretium rents to 2,500 households with vouchers already, according to its website.\nThe company declined the outlet’s request for comment on its plan.\nPretium’s motivation could have something to do with elevated borrowing costs. The company reportedly sees an opportunity to acquire properties at prices that could deliver better yields than what it may earn at higher price points.\n\nWhile Pretium owns and manages nearly 100,000 single-family rentals, the traditional aspects of the business are not what they once were a few years ago. When interest rates that cratered at the beginning of the pandemic skyrocketed, it became more challenging to purchase homes and garner sufficient rent to cover mortgage payments.\nPretium’s most recent newsworthy acquisition came almost two years ago, when it bought\n$1.5 billion\nworth of homes from D.R. Horton, 4,000 properties largely in the Southeast and Southwest parts of the country.\nThe Section 8 program is\nfacing its own set of issues\nas Donald Trump’s administration rattles the federal government. Layoffs, funding shortfalls and regulations are threatening the nation’s largest rental assistance initiative for low-income families.\nA budget proposed by the House of Representatives could result in approximately 283,000 households losing voucher access in what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities called “the most severe funding shortfall in the history of the voucher program.”\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "The Canero Group is planning a 54-unit townhouse project in Homestead, aiming to appeal to Miami locals priced out by the area’s luxury boom.\nThe Coral Gables-based firm scored Miami-Dade County’s approval for a total of 66 townhouses for the 2.7-acre site at 27800 Old Dixie Highway, but decided against using the total allotment, President Jose A. Canero confirmed. The units will each span 1,900 square feet with three bedrooms, and prices will start at $500,000, he said.\nCanero said his target demographic is local buyers getting priced out of the Miami area’s urban centers. Edward Silva of Miami-based E.S.A. Architects is designing the townhomes. Construction is expected to begin early next year, Canero said.\n\nThe firm dropped $537,500 on the\nHomestead\ndevelopment site in 2023, property records show. Holland &amp; Knight attorneys Juan Mayol and Oliver Wechsler represented Canero in the approval process.\nCanero’s townhomes are the latest in a stacked pipeline of planned residential developments in south Miami-Dade County. The firm also has\na 223-unit rental building\nin the works at 24735 South Dixie Highway in Princeton.\nNearby in Homestead, Lennar proposed\n119 single-family homes\non 58 acres in January. In October, Bluenest Development bought a 20-acre site in Homestead for\n$12.5 million\n, with plans for 219 townhouses.",

    "content": "Douglas Elliman tallied another year of losses as it faced leadership shakeups, lawsuits and scrutiny.\nThe firm reported a net loss of $76 million in 2024, up from the $43 million it lost in the previous year. Its operating loss was $69 million, compared to $65 million in 2023.\nNews of Elliman’s financials comes after a rocky few months for the firm, which added a new CEO for the first time in two decades. Michael Liebowitz took over the helm of the company in October, following the\nsudden retirement\nof longtime CEO and chairman Howard Lorber.\nWith his new role, Liebowitz\nvowed to focus\non improving the company’s performance by diversifying its revenue stream through acquiring ancillary businesses and expanding internationally. He described himself in an interview with Business Insider as “very much an operator” compared to Lorber, who “was not an operational person at all.”\nThough Elliman fell further into the red, the company managed to up its revenue to nearly $1 billion in 2024, up from the $960 million it reported the year prior.\n“We are building momentum,” Liebowitz said on the call. “Our agents and employees are energized as we lead Douglas Elliman into a new era.”\nElliman continued to slash spending last year, continuing a cost-cutting campaign it ramped up in 2023 after rising mortgage rates and low inventory stalled the housing market. The firm reduced its expenses by roughly $20 million in 2024.\n“The management team remains focused on Douglas Elliman’s transformation,” chief financial officer Bryant Kirkland said on the call.\nHe added that the company’s “core operations” were starting to reap the benefits of cost cutting, as well as investments in its development marketing business. Kirkland said the firm’s new development pipeline is worth $28 billion, with about $18 billion in Florida alone. He expects about $5 billion in new development to come to market by March 2026.\nElliman has been on a quarterly losing streak for the past two years, but the firm narrowed the gap in the fourth quarter. It reported a net loss of $6 million, compared to $15 million in the same period in 2023.\nThe company reported an operating loss of $16 million, less than the $24 million it lost a year ago.\n\nThe firm also reported $243 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, up from $214 million in 2023. Elliman finished the year with $145 million in cash and investment securities.\nA turbulent 2025\nThe end of the year was a turbulent one for the residential giant. The company upended its leadership at the end of last year, and Liebowitz, a board member, took the reins.\nThe shakeup began when Lorber abruptly resigned from his post in October under pressure from the board.\nHis departure followed an internal investigation into the company’s culture, after sexual assault allegations surfaced against two of its former top brokers, Tal and Oren Alexander. During the investigation, Lorber\nadmitted to having\nintimate relationships with two of the firm’s agents, Bloomberg reported.\nBoth Lorber and Elliman were\nnamed as defendants\nin one of the latest lawsuits filed against the Alexanders and their brother Alon, who were arrested on federal sex trafficking charges in December. The complaint accuses the firm and its former executive of knowing about the brothers’ alleged behavior and enabling it during their time as agents.\nDays after Lorber’s exit, Elliman\nterminated Scott Durkin\n, the CEO of its brokerage segment. The firm tapped Richard Ferrari, the head of its Northeast and New York regions, to take his place. Elliman’s chief operating officer Richard Lampen also\nretired in December\n.\nThe upheaval continued into the start of 2025, when the CEO of firm’s Western region,\nStephen Kotler, resigned\namid multiple lawsuits over alleged kickback schemes involving reality TV stars and one of the company’s escrow businesses. The lawsuits have since been settled, and Kotler is still working with the firm as an agent.\nAlong with Kotler’s departure, the firm also closed two of its offices in California, including one in Malibu and the other in Pasadena. In December, Elliman also\ntook over the lease\nfor an office in Miami’s Design District that once belonged to its former parent company, Vector Group.\nDespite the chaos, Liebowitz ended the call on an optimistic note, touting his faith in the company and improvements on the horizon.\n“When we last spoke in November, I told you I took on the CEO role because I believed in the Douglas Elliman brand,” Liebowitz said. “Our best days are ahead for this company.”\n",

    "content": "Two new long-term retail leases have been signed at Mission Rock, and a long-awaited French bakery has opened its doors in the development.\nBlue Bottle Coffee and Sweetgreen have both signed 10-year leases at the 28-acre Mission Bay development, which is owned by the Port of San Francisco and was formerly a parking lot for the Giants, according to a news release Tuesday from developers Tishman Speyer and the San Francisco Giants.\nThe development team is now wrapping up its first phase with two apartment buildings and two office towers, one of which is Visa’s market support center, which provides resources for the credit card company’s clients and businesses globally.\nOakland-founded Blue Bottle will occupy 2,069 square feet at the base of the Visa building at 300 Toni Stone Crossing. The 13-story tower houses nearly 1,000 Visa employees, according to the company’s website.\nSalad and grain bowl shop Sweetgreen will take just under 2,400 square feet at the base of The Canyon, a residential tower at the intersection of Dr. Maya Angelou Lane and Toni Strone Crossing. A representative for Tishman Speyer said that the developer anticipates both Sweetgreen and Blue Bottle will be submitting their permits shortly. The rep declined to give any further information on tenant improvement allowances or lease terms.\nCBRE’s Alex Sagues and Madeline Mandanis represented Mission Rock Partners. Blue Bottle was represented by Benzi Blatman with CBRE, while Sweetgreen was represented by AJ Schrader with Tier One Retail Group.\nSagues called Mission Bay “the most vibrant neighborhood in San Francisco.” He said retailers are drawn to the transit-friendly area because “it is a true seven-day neighborhood,” with office, life science, residential, and the UCSF hospital, as well as events at Chase Center and Oracle Park.\nBeloved French bakery Arsicault, known as much for its long lines as its buttery pastries, was announced as a retail tenant in Mission Rock\nin the summer of 2023\nand just opened this week. It is the San Francisco pastry-makers’ third location, after expanding from its original location in the Inner Richmond into Civic Center in 2020. It signed a 10-year lease for nearly 2,500 square feet at the base of the Verde apartment tower in Mission Bay, according to the developers. At least to start, its Mission Rock offerings will be the same as at their other locations.\n\n“Our bakery honors traditional pastry-making techniques while Mission Rock represents San Francisco’s vibrant future,” Arsicault owner Armando Lacayo said in a statement. “The combination feels perfect for this community where tradition and innovation blend together seamlessly.”\nIn a statement, San Francisco Giants vice president of real estate development Julian Pancoast called the arrival of Arsicault, and signing of Blue Bottle and Sweetgreen leases, “exceptional additions” that were “carefully selected” to “enhance our vision of being a welcoming destination for all to enjoy.”\nA Giants representative added that it is important to “curate” a variety of brands and concepts for the neighborhood to hit a wide range of price points and tastes.\n“Our goal is to create a dynamic retail ecosystem that supports daily residents and office users while making Mission Rock a destination people visit often, for a variety of experiences,” the rep said via email.\nAdditional retailers will continue to be announced on a rolling basis, according to the press release. So far, much like Arsicault, the strategy seems to be to bring in mostly local brands with an avid following, but without a Mission Bay presence.\nIke’s Love &amp; Sandwiches, LuxFit gym and Proper Food all opened in Mission Rock last summer. The first permanent outpost of Quik Dog, a burger restaurant that began during the pandemic as a temporary-take out window at renowned Mission cocktail bar Trick Dog, will also open in the coming months. So will Flour + Water Pizza Shop, and a full-service restaurant from the team behind Che Fico on Divisadero. The new Che Fico restaurant will presumably have more offerings than the Che Fico Pizzeria that opened blocks away at Chase Center’s Thrive City last fall.\nIt’s not the only crossover between the Golden Gate Warriors’ home stadium and Mission Rock. The Warriors confirmed that the team\nwould be taking 71,000 square feet\nin Mission Rock’s Building B. It was the first lease signed in the nearly 300,000-square-foot building, which was\nbuilt as life sciences space\nbefore pivoting back to traditional office space.\n",

The entertainment group made a counter offer to hold a $30 million policy for the next two years, which the county had yet to accept late last week.\nCity staff were concerned that a paperwork delay could cause investors to pull their funding and kill the redevelopment deal. The entertainment group and Loop Capital, a major Black-owned investment firm based in Chicago, could not be reached by the Business Times for comment.\n\nCounty negotiators said they had expected to have the required paperwork to allow for final approval from supervisors on Tuesday,\naccording to the San Francisco Chronicle\n.\nThe Coliseum complex includes the stadium, the arena, administrative offices and acres of parking. The entertainment group’s proposed\n$5 billion redevelopment\nproject calls for homes, hotels, a convention center, youth amphitheater, restaurants and museums, while retaining the aging stadium.\nIn 2019, the A’s bought the county’s share of the site for $85 million, and were in the process of paying for it when the team left Oakland for Las Vegas.\nIn July, the entertainment group agreed to buy the city’s share of the Coliseum property for\n$105 million\n.\nIn August, the MLB franchise struck a deal with the entertainment group to sell its stake for\n$125 million\n, which required final approval by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

That’s $191,000 per unit.\nFPA assumed the balance of Rockwell’s existing mortgage, about $39.8 million, which carries an interest rate under 3.6 percent and matures in 2029. The assumable debt likely sweetened the deal, as interest rates for this type of asset hover near 5.22 percent.\nNewmark brokers Susan Lawson, Chuck Johanns and Elizabeth Gagliardi represented Rockwell in the transaction.\nThe deal also reflects the growing appeal of DuPage County, which investors view as less burdensome for property taxes as Cook County.\nRental demand is strong, with median net rent rising 4.4 percent year over year in the fourth quarter to $2.90 per square foot, according to Integra Realty Resources.\n\nHuntington Apartments, built in 1973.

Rockwell invested close to $50 million into the acquisition and property upgrades, including $7 million to renovate 90 percent of the units and enhance amenities like the clubhouse.\nFPA Multifamily has been an active investor in the Chicago-area market.\nLast month it\nsold the 294-unit ReNew Downers Grove apartments\nfor $72.1 million, and last year acquired properties in\nHoffman Estates\nand\nChicago’s South Loop\nfor more than $100 million each.\n— Judah Duke\n",

It has already invested millions into the campaign, and Dumont’s promotion could place him at the forefront.\nDumont, president and COO of Sands, is also the son-in-law of billionaire Miriam Adelson, Sands’ majority shareholder and widow of company founder Sheldon Adelson.

    "content": "A suburban Atlanta office property sold for almost half of its previous value.\nRG Real Estate acquired the TownPark Commons office complex in Kennesaw for $42 million following a foreclosure, the Atlanta Business Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe four-building complex spans 350,000 square feet on more than 20 acres off George Busbee Parkway. The price was $120 per square foot, about 47 percent less than the $79 million it was appraised for in April 2021.\nThe property was part of Adventus Realty Services’ portfolio, the property management company for Adventus Realty Trust, Rick Charlton’s Vancouver-based REIT, which\nfiled for bankruptcy\nin July 2023. The portfolio was tied to a $350 million securitized commercial mortgage.\nThe trust representing loan investors\nforeclosed on Adventus’ metro Atlanta holdings\nin December, along with the company’s Chicago assets. Together, they totaled 2.2 million square feet of space.\nThe deal, facilitated by KeyBank National Association on behalf of a trust, closed on Feb. 28, the latest sign of a\nchurning market under pressure\n.\n\nThe complex is 96 percent occupied, according to a JLL brochure. It includes 701 Barrett Lakes Boulevard and 125, 175 and 225 Townpark Drive Northwest.\nNo major changes are planned for TownPark Commons, RG Real Estate founder and President Ryan Goldstein said, though “small capital improvements” could be made “strategically.”\nThis acquisition follows RG Real Estate’s purchase of the discounted Overlook I office building in Vinings last November. The firm’s strategy aligns with a broader trend of recalibration in Atlanta’s office sector.\nOffice sales in the metro area totaled $1.35 billion last year, up from $589 million in 2023, according to CommercialEdge.\nNearly 23 percent of all securitized debt backed by office properties is delinquent, the seventh highest rate out of the top 25 major metro areas in the country, totaling 166 distressed properties and $2.1 billion in distressed debt, according to\ndata from Trepp\n.\n— Judah Duke\n",

The six-story studio offices would contain floor-to-ceiling windows and broad white eaves, supported by round vertical pillars, according to a rendering.\nPending approvals, Prologis would break ground in 2027 and be completed by 2029.\nPrologis bought the former bus terminal in 2021 for\n$91 million\n. Greyhound has moved its L.A. buses to\nUnion Station Patsaouras Transit Plaza\n.\nThe project is one of three large studio developments in the works along the Alameda corridor in Downtown Los Angeles, following similar projects at\n6th\nand\n8th Streets\n, according to Urbanize.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "A Spanish-style mansion in a gated Laguna Niguel community sold for $16.3 million, marking a new record for the city.\nThe sale of 7 Searidge beats out the city’s previous all-time residential high of $15 million for a two-lot transaction at 6 Inspiration that closed in 2014.\nPhillip Caruso, the lead listing agent and part of Christie’s International Real Estate Southern California, said the best comparable to 7 Searidge may be an off-market deal for a 14,000-square-foot home recorded in the same community of Bear Brand Ranch that traded for $12 million in 2015, but there are no other details beyond that.\nCaruso listed the property with his father, Michael Caruso. Their group\njoined Christie’s International Real Estate Southern California\nlast year.\nThe seller was an out-of-state land developer who the Carusos have counted as a long-time client. The mystery buyer was represented by Pacific Sotheby’s International Realty’s AJ Olson Whitfield.\nPhillip Caruso pointed out 7 Searidge still beats out all records in the city on a price-per-square-foot basis, in which the deal penciled out to $1,993 per square foot. That beats out the city’s former record set in 2014, which equated to $625 per square foot.\n“This is an incredible achievement, especially when considering economies of scale,” Caruso said in an email to\nThe Real Deal\n. “Typically, as homes get larger in size, the price per square foot goes down, and as homes are smaller, price per square foot goes up. To be the highest ever in any size home is a testament to the quality, design, build, style and the marketing of this home.”\n\nHomes penciling out to $2,000 per square foot are typically in\nNewport Beach\nor coastal markets, Caruso pointed out.\nThe home on Searidge was designed by Spectrum Architecture and built by Elevated Building Group, with an interior designed by Laura Brophy of Brophy Interiors.\nIt’s a couple miles from the beach, has six bedrooms, eight bathrooms and totals over 8,000 square feet. Among the home’s highlights are a media room, gym, private courtyard, infinity pool, gardens and outdoor kitchen.\nThe purchase price reflects an increase from the just under $16 million listing price, which Caruso attributed to the city’s proximity to several major retail projects.\nThat includes the recently opened\nRiver Street Marketplace\nin San Juan Capistrano and the in-progress revitalization of Dana Point Harbor, which began about a year ago.\n“These are definitely helping to attract a buyer demographic who appreciates more retail and community lifestyle in their locales,” Caruso said. “I have helped numerous clients purchase homes and move from L.A. [and] Newport Beach to Laguna Niguel. You can achieve more on a purchase [or] lease in terms of size, quality and amenities. More bang for your buck.”\nPrices in the city spiked in January more than 40 percent compared to a year earlier, reaching a median price of $1.7 million, according to the most recent data from Redfin.\n",

Parking would accommodate 330 cars.\nIn January, a typical home in the town south of San Jose sold for $2.5 million, up 39.7 percent from a year earlier,\naccording to Redfin\n. Rob Moore, vice mayor for Los Gatos, said the new townhomes would allow people like him a shot at owning a home.\n“I’m one of the one-third of renters that lives in the town of Los Gatos who, as it currently stands, does not have a pathway to home ownership in this town,” he told the council. “When I see this sort of development where these units are likely to go for less than a single-family home goes for in Los Gatos, I see a place where I could see myself potentially living one day.”\nThe Planning Commission\nunanimously recommended\nthe project’s approval last month. SummerHill applied under SB 330, which fast-tracks approvals for cities that are out of compliance with state-\nmandated housing plans\n.\nThe developer could have invoked the\nbuilder’s remedy\n, a legal loophole in state housing law that allows developers to bypass local zoning rules in cities that haven’t certified their housing element plans, providing they include enough affordable housing, according to the Spotlight.\n\nBut the unit of Calabasas-based Marcus &amp; Millichap didn’t in an effort to work with the town.\nThe town must plan to build 1,993 homes by 2031, 847 of which must be affordable to low-income residents.\nThe developer expects to break ground this year, with model homes expected to be built by summer 2027.\nJohn Hickey, vice president of development at SummerHill, said project amenities will help future residents, as well as the surrounding neighborhood. SummerHill Homes has also built the homes at\nBellaterra @ North 40\n, in Los Gatos.\nSummerHil, founded in 1976, has developed more than 7,000 homes in the Bay Area and Southern California, according to its LinkedIn page.\nLast month, the firm partnered with the Houston-based Hanover Company, which paid\n$78.3 million\nfor a century-old fruit stand and orchard at 2620 Seely Avenue in San Jose, with plans to build more than 1,600 homes.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Alexander Mehran Jr. is the\nthird generation of his family\nto run the Sunset Development Company, the San Ramon-based developer and owner behind the 585-acre Bishop Ranch office park, about an hour east of San Francisco. But even though he grew up in the office development world and has been at Sunset Development since 2009, following a stint in New York at Goldman Sachs, Mehran told\nThe Real Deal\nhe still can’t predict what will happen in the Bay Area’s uncertain office market.\n“I threw a dart at the wall,” he joked, when explaining how he decided which of his family’s office properties should be razed to create 300,000 square feet of retail and entertainment at Bishop Ranch’s CityCenter, which opened in 2018, as well as 8,000 planned new housing units.\n“It’s roughly half of what we had,” he said of the company’s current 8 million square feet of commercial space. “It’s the best stuff. I think that as [we] move forward, more people will want to be here. That’s a complete guess. I have no idea.”\nBut Mehran said he is sure that adding a residential component — including a recently opened 177-unit luxury senior assisted living facility from Belmont Village and 404 for-sale single-family homes and duplexes by SummerHill Homes — will be “accretive” to the rest of the community, even if it also means giving up some long-held control.\n“I know that adding people is going to drive the place forward,” he said. “I know that some people have to be owners, and that’s a scary thing. We’ve only had a handful of owners for 40 years here: Chevron, Toyota, Pac Bell and us.”\nSunset sold land to Chevron and Pacific Bell in the early 1980s only to buy it back as both companies downsized and relocated over the last decade. PacBell, now AT&amp;T, sold its 1.8 million-square-foot former headquarters for $250 million in 2014 and Chevron followed, selling its over 1 million-square-foot headquarters\nfor $175 million in 2022\n.\nToday, both are tenants in the former PacBell space, which is now dubbed Lakeside as it overlooks the man-made Annabel Lake. Since the pandemic, AT&amp;T has listed\nlarge subleases\non the 900,000 square feet they agreed to lease back at Lakeside as part of the sale. The former Chevron HQ is now called The Orchards, and the 92-acre property is working its way through the planning process to\nbecome a mix of office, retail and 2,500 new homes\n.\nThe dramatic downsize from two of Bishop Ranch’s biggest players is indicative of broader market trends, and Mehran said developers and owners need to accept that the time where companies were wowed by full-building opportunities is likely coming to a close. When HR firm Robert Half moved from its own 250,000-square-foot building at Bishop Ranch to 70,000 square feet in Lakeside, that was “a big blow,” he said. But he also wasn’t waiting around for another single company to take its place.\n“Strategically, it’s pretty easy for me to just cut it up and multitenant it,” he said, adding that these days having a completely empty office building isn’t exactly a strong calling card. “If you’re walking around with a customer and you’re like, ‘Oh we’ve got this whole building,’ it’s like, ‘Whoa, these guys are in trouble.’”\n\nSunset has also recently begun turning empty offices into turnkey spec suites, which can have lease terms for as short as one year. Mehran said they have rented quickly even at a $1 per-square-foot premium. He’d rather take the shorter-term lease, but put in finishes he knows many tenants will like, instead of something bespoke for a tenant who eventually moves on.\n“I’ve just seen a lot of customers build things that don’t matter in five years or don’t really provide value,” he said.\nSunset is also transforming other underutilized spaces into amenities like gyms, restaurants and coffee spots. Flourish opened in The Orchards last fall and the cafe-style coworking space has everything from private Zoom rooms to conference and collaboration space, as well as a full coffee bar, breakfast and lunch menus, and evening events. Another Flourish with a plant theme is already in the works in the Sycamore office complex of Bishop Ranch and will open in the near future.\n“What I learned with the big building, Lakeside, was if you don’t have things like this people don’t want to be there,” Mehran said.\nSome may want the gourmet coffee experience, others the extra conference space or the ability to entertain clients. Whatever tenants need, Mehran wants to be able to provide it because in today’s highly competitive office world, he said, developers can’t risk being caught without everything on tenants’ lengthy checklists.\n“It’s a binary thing,” he said. “It’s between a one and a zero of, ‘Am I going to sign a lease and have an office or am I not?’” he said.\nChanging Bishop Ranch also means finding new financing partners “who believe in you and allow you to make that shift,” Mehran said. Sunset has a long-standing relationship with Wells Fargo, which financed its purchase of Lakeside and the development of CityCenter, but it recently broadened to CitiGroup and Comerica, Mehran said.\nIt’s not easy getting a loan on offices, given the level of distress in the space and “it takes a long time for fear to exit these institutions,” Mehran said. But the new leases he’s been signing since 2022 seem like strong indications that people are figuring out their post-pandemic requirements, he said.\nIn all the uncertainty, Mehran said he’s keeping his eye on the long term, since that’s what Sunset does best.\n“I like progress,” he said. “We have a lot of energy behind us and what we’re doing is very tricky and has consequences for the next many, many decades. But we have a really thoughtful team and I believe in it.”\n",

    "content": "Storefronts in historic Jackson Square are hot — and a luxury alternative to Union Square.\nWhile Ralph Lauren has returned to San Francisco with a new store at 441 Jackson Street, restaurateur Peter Hemsley and the Brick &amp; Timber Collective have paid $32.4 million for a 15,600-square-foot store and building at 530 Jackson Street, the\nSan Francisco Chronicle\nand the\nSan Francisco Business Times\nreported.\nThe tony district that harkens back to the Gold Rush has seen an\ninflux of luxury retailers\nlike Paul Smith, Isabel Marant and Zimmermann. At the same time, many retailers have left nearby Union Square, with an\nexit planned by Macy’s\n.\nNew York-based Ralph Lauren had a store at 2040 Fillmore Street, which closed in 2020.  It also had a location in the\nCrocker Galleria\nthat shuttered in 2013.\nIts new store, which replaces a Senreve apparel shop, was designed to reflect the rich history of Jackson Square, with a contemporary twist, an unidentified Ralph Lauren spokesperson told the Chronicle. It’s dark green, with hand-painted gold leaf and brass signs, along with stained oak floors and white-painted brick walls.\nTerms of the lease, as well as the owner of the building, were not disclosed.\n“The opening of Polo Ralph Lauren in Jackson Square is a testament to the neighborhood’s growing appeal as a premier destination for retail,” Robbie Silver, CEO of the Downtown SF Partnership,\nsaid in a statement\n.\nIt was Hemsley who announced last year he would shut down the Michelin-starred Aphotic, pointing the blame squarely to its location in South of Market.\n“There are few left in San Francisco that aspire to provide services like we do at Aphotic, and the smart and lucky ones in the pack are located in the right storefront, on the right block, and in the right part of town,” he wrote on Instagram.\nNow Hemsley seems to have found that right location.\n\nIn a deal that closed last week, he and the locally based Brick &amp; Timber bought the Jackson Street storefront a block from the Ralph Lauren shop for $2,075 per square foot, the Business Times reported, citing public records and unidentified sources.\nThe seller of the four-story office and retail building was the McAleese family, which has run the former Kells Irish Pub and Restaurant and occupied its ground floor for more than two decades.\nBrick &amp; Timber plans to revamp the building, and keep it for the long haul, according to founder Glenn Gilmore.\nPartner Jesse Feldman described Hemsley as “a world-class culinary talent,” and said the pair mutually felt the building would serve as “a special location for the next chapter in his story,” according to a statement.\nIt’s not clear whether the chef intends to revive Aphotic, or launch a new restaurant.\nJackson Square has emerged as a bright spot in Downtown San Francisco. Former Apple designer Jony Ive has\nspent almost $100 million\nbuying up buildings in the area. There’s also Michael Shvo’s $1 billion bet on the Transamerica Pyramid.\nBrick &amp; Timber, founded in 2013 by Glenn Gilmore, developed its chops\nturning Gold Rush-era warehouses into offices for venture capitalists\nalong the North Waterfront. With nine buildings in Jackson Square, the Jackson Square-based collective is “arguably the predominant real estate investor” in the North Waterfront, partner Jesse Feldman\ntold The Real Deal last month\n.\nIn December, the firm bought an eight-story 115,600-square-foot building at 500 Washington Street for $32.7 million, or $282 per square foot,\nTRD reported.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

The site was initially intended for self-storage development but pivoted toward residential use.\n\nJohnston also sold a nearby 1.2-acre pad last year, where a Dollar Tree opened in February. He still holds about 62 acres in the area, including 16 acres under contract with a multifamily developer and 5 acres brokered for retail.\nInfrastructure improvements are underway, with Johnston planning to sell the remaining land once sewer installations are completed this winter and a traffic light is installed by the Texas Department of Transportation.\nPrinceton is the nation’s third fastest-growing city; its population increased 22 percent from mid-2020 to mid-2023, U.S. Census data shows.\nIt is growing so fast that officials in January extended a moratorium on development, to address infrastructure needs, until this summer.\nLennar’s tracts are outside of the moratorium area, however.\n— Judah Duke\n",

So far, deeds for 40 units have been recorded by Miami-Dade County. Condos range from studios to three-bedroom units, spanning 466 square feet to 1,200 square feet, according to a press release.\nAmenities in the building include a pool deck, fitness center, pet spa, co-working lounge and a kids’ playroom, the website shows. Michelin-starred chef Carlo Mirarchi is also opening a seventh location of Roberta’s, his award-winning Brooklyn pizza restaurant, on the ground floor.\nCondo sales launched in 2023 with prices ranging from $700,000 to $2.4 million, with Cervera Real Estate leading sales and marketing. For remaining units, prices start at $800,000, the release shows.\n\nChudaitov said buyers for 72 Park have come “from all walks of life,” and included locals, as well as Californians, New Yorkers and Chicagoans. 72 Park marks the first condo completed in North Beach in five years. In 2017, Miami Beach\nresidents voted to increase density\nfor North Beach projects, setting the stage for\na new wave of development\nin the neighborhood.\n“I just see a really incredible community coming to life over there,” Chudaitov said.\nLefferts partnered with\nRussell Galbut\nto buy the 72 Park site for $17 million in 2015 and 2019, records show.

    "content": "Not everything goes in Houston’s famously regulation-light development landscape.\nPlans for a mixed-use high-rise in Montrose were thrown into uncertainty after the city’s planning commission rejected a key variance request, the Houston Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe owners of the long-standing Khun Kay Thai Cafe at 1209 Montrose want to replace it with an 18 to 20-story condo building, public records show.\nAnuch Pongsanarakul and Tanawat Sumrith, using the business name SUPO Corporation, pitched 46 units and a 3,200-square-foot restaurant on the ground floor.\nThe rejection hinged on the developers’ request to build the tower 16 feet closer to Montrose Boulevard than setback rules allow. The Houston Planning Commission voted against it last week.\nThe owners don’t appear to have a history in real estate. The site plan was submitted by Houston-based CE Engineers &amp; Development Consultants.\nThe reduced setback was essential for including an enclosed parking garage in lieu of surface parking, the owner said.\n\nCity staff pushed back, saying the high-rise was “disproportionate to the size of the property” and inconsistent with the surrounding development patterns.

    "content": "Chicago’s condo market set another record for this year.\nFormer Fortune Brands CEO Bruce Carbonari sold his 5,400-square-foot Gold Coast penthouse  in the Elm and State building for $10.1 million Friday, Crain’s\nreported\n. It sold for $1,870 per square foot and is the priciest home to sell in Chicago this year.\nIt hit the market\nin July for $10.8 million\n, about $2,000 per square foot, and found a buyer within two months but took six months to close.\nSellers Bruce and Kate Carbonari bought the entire 23rd floor as raw space for $6.7 million in 2016 and spent at least $1.5 million into the buildout, permit records show.\nThey bought when the building was new; the 194,000-square-foot tower at 4 East Elm was completed in 2016 and designed by SCB. It holds only two units per floor, ranging between 3,100 and 3,500 square feet and each is served by its own private elevator, according to SCB’s website.\nThe Carbonaris decided to sell after spending more time in Detroit with their grandchildren and at their Florida home. Bruce retired as Fortune Brands chairman and CEO after 22 years in 2011.\nSharon O’Hara and Carrie McCormick represented the sellers, and Emily Sachs Wong represented the buyers, all with @properties Christie’s International Real Estate. The buyer wasn’t identified.\nThe Carbonaris redesigned the living room and adjacent balcony to create an indoor-outdoor space featuring a 12-foot-high glass wall and french doors.\n\nThe result is a panoramic view spanning Chicago’s skyline, Lake Michigan and the surrounding neighborhoods. Additional terraces occupy the building’s northeast and northwest corners, with about 1,700 square feet of outdoor space.\nDowntown condos have accounted for eight of the top 10 highest-priced home sales in the Chicago area this year before counting two $12 million mansions and another $35 million home in Winnetka, which went under contract last week and in early February, respectively.\nChicago’s luxury condo market is\nshowing early signs of a rebound\nafter years of sluggish sales.\nUltra-high-end buyers have been selective, gravitating toward properties that avoid the stigma of long market stays or bulk sales.\nNewer projects, like Crescent Heights, at 850 Lake Shore Drive, have gained traction by pricing units competitively, while older developments like the St. Regis have struggled with slower sales and bulk transactions.\nSo far, 21 homes have sold for $4 million or more this year, outpacing the 16 sold by this time last year.\n— Judah Duke\n",

They are among the priciest deals in the area this year, along with a $35 million mansion that went under contract in early February.\nThe 9,650-square-foot, seven-bedroom home at 973 Sheridan Road, was built five years ago on about 2 acres.

    "content": "Tenants in Los Angeles won a temporary victory as their landlords are now barred by the city from evicting them over major renovations.\nThe City Council unanimously voted on an ordinance launched by Council member Bob Blumenfield to temporarily bar landlords from booting tenants in order to complete a “substantial remodel,”\nCity News Service reported\n.\nThe eviction ban during renovations will last through Aug. 1, while city staff work on a permanent solution to “close a loophole” proponents say allows investors to kick out tenants for remodeling, then jack up rents. To take effect, it will require approval by Mayor Karen Bass.\nDavid Kaishchyan of the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles said the policy will force renters to live in dangerous conditions, while tying the hands of responsible owners.\n“This ordinance is a result of a witch hunt by extremists that want to force mom-and-pop owners out of business,” Kaishchyan told the council.\nHe claimed data from the city’s Housing Department show that “renovictions” are a “hoax,” with less than 100 substantial remodels occurring in the past two years.\n“We strongly urge a ‘no vote’ on this outrageous moratorium that once again rips the rug out from under housing providers and shows the city to be unreliable and openly hostile to them,” Kaishchyan said.\nThe ordinance will retroactively apply to tenants, meaning it could provide a defense in court for renters who have yet to receive judgment for this particular eviction proceeding, according to City News.\nThe city deems a substantial remodel as a “no-fault” eviction, in which tenants in good standing can be evicted if their unit requires major structural, electrical, plumbing or mechanical system work.\n\nProperty owners must self-certify that it will take 30 days or more to complete such projects.\nLandlords of rent-stabilized units, however, must provide a plan to temporarily relocate tenants if the unit requires a substantial remodel. The plan must be submitted to the Housing Department, and the tenant has to agree before it can be carried out.\nLast year, the council approved a motion introduced by Blumenfield, who called for the temporary ban on evictions for substantial remodels, saying an ordinance would “close a loophole.”\n“Hundreds of families are caught in this type of eviction process, with no ability to keep their units,” Blumenfield said in a previous statement. “My policy will ensure that a tenant has the ability to maintain tenancy, keep paying rent and stay in their apartments.”\nCouncil members worried that some units taken off the market for remodeling are added later at higher rents.\nThe City Council also instructed the Housing Department to provide information on how many property owners are applying for substantial remodels, how many projects have been completed and how many evictions are caused by efforts to electrify units.\nLaura Matter, a senior staff attorney with Inner City Law Center, said many renters in L.A. are facing eviction proceedings related to substantial remodeling efforts.\n“This is a provision that investors use to flip properties and it goes against the purpose of Just Cause Ordinance, which was to prohibit arbitrary evictions,” Matter told the council.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

A foreclosure auction is on the books for April 10.\nThe Philadelphia-based developer landed a $66.7 million loan from AllianceBernstein two years ago, but the balance has since ballooned to $77.9 million. The loan matured a few months ago.\nPost Brothers president Matthew Pestronk expressed hope the issue could be resolved amicably and with the developer still in place, saying the company was “actively working” on raising funds.\nPost Brothers acquired the property in 2023 from Network Realty Partners and Meadow Partners for $66.7 million. The office asset was previously the longtime home of the Urban Institute before an announced departure in 2017.\n\nIn October, the developer secured approval from the Board of Zoning Adjustment for a conversion to a 400-unit apartment building with 20,000 square feet of ground floor retail space, according to the\nCommercial Observer\n.\nWhile Post Brothers fights for its West End redevelopment, the firm is forging ahead with the district’s largest conversion so far. The developer’s $400 million conversion of the Universal Buildings at 1825 and 1875 Connecticut Avenue NW is expected to yield 600 units and 700,000 square feet. Post Brothers tapped a 20-year tax incentive for conversions in the district, which is expected to save the company $95 million in property taxes.\nD.C. ranks\nsecond in the nation\nin office-to-residential unit pipeline, according to RentCafe, trailing only New York City. There are 71,000 units in the national pipeline, a record-breaking total in the firm’s tracking and a tripling of the number of units in the works three years ago.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "Infamous landowner Suzie Wilson is facing a potential ban from owning Chicago property, after inspiring the creation of the city’s new special collections unit designed to help go after its largest, most indebted landlords more efficiently.\nThe city is pushing to bar Wilson — who racked up over $15 million in fines for municipal property violations — from ever investing in Chicago real estate again as part of any settlement that might be reached in her bankruptcy, deputy city attorney David Holtkamp said. And Chicago’s efforts to crack down on negligent property owners aren’t going to end with her.\nThe playbook used to take down Wilson forms the basis for the city’s new special collections unit — a group of attorneys housed under the Chicago Law Department’s Collections, Ownership, and Administrative Litigation Division. It hired three more attorneys with funds recovered from Wilson’s debts and will work with the city’s Department of Streets and Sanitation to monitor property inspections and citations for landowners that owe significant amounts to the city.\nThey are starting with about 10 landowners in particular that hit a certain threshold of unpaid fines and fees with the city, including two the city has publicly filed “additional enforcement actions” against in recent months. Those are Hinsdale-based QCD Financial and Grayslake-based Goldmine Investments, which the city referred to as large-scale “land speculators” that “gobble up vacant lots in hopes of getting rich,” according to city litigation.\nQCD has been found liable “at least 1,618 times” for municipal code violations across 125 properties it owns, allegedly amassing over $3.8 million in fines and interest since 2013, according to court records. Goldmine allegedly owes the city over $5.2 million in fines from more than 1,500 counts of blight-related code violations, records show.\nIn both cases, the special collections unit moved to consolidate judgements made against the owners in city administrative hearings into lawsuits filed with the Cook County Circuit Court over the last few months.\n“Once you discover a pattern and a practice, then that allows you to begin an entire mechanism of researching and tracking down owners,” said Mary Richardson-Lowry, Chicago’s top legal advisor.\nShe wouldn’t disclose the identity of the other landowners being targeted by the collections unit or the amount of debt the city is using as its threshold to pursue. Most own vacant lots, like Wilson, but some also own occupied residential properties, Holtkamp said in a statement. (\nThe Real Deal\nhas made a formal public records request to determine the property owners.)\nRichardson-Lowry recalled talking to aldermen about the trouble they were having with negligent landowners like these just a few months after she was hired by the city in June of 2023.\nThe city lacked a system to track the ownership of vacant lots that weren’t being cared for, especially when owners didn’t want to be found, and Richardson-Lowry wanted to change that, she said.\nWith Holtkamp, she began to uncover just how pervasive the issue of abandoned, vacant lots in the city is, she said. Private owners held nearly 32,000 vacant lots in Chicago as of the 2021 tax year, according to\nCook County Assessor data\n.\nThey found many non-responsive owners who don’t keep their lots clean, fail to pay taxes or fines on time, and shift the property’s ownership between countless legal entities to avoid being tracked, Richardson-Lowry said.\nBut there was one name that stood out from the rest, one they kept seeing: Suzie Wilson.\nSo, they went after her with every tool they had: enforcing existing judgments, bringing new cases and connecting her name to the legal entities that many of her properties were purchased under.\nA year-and-a-half later, she was\nforced to sell 812 properties\nas part of a bankruptcy case filed in the fall. The properties, which are being marketed by Hilco Real Estate, are concentrated in low-income areas, predominantly on the South and West sides of the city.\n“These are communities where blight is viewed as part of their DNA,” Richardson-Lowry said. “Now we have a person that we can directly attribute to part of the cause of the blight in certain communities. So, that’s how we began.”\nAn attorney representing Wilson and various LLCs named as “interested parties” in the bankruptcy filing did not respond to requests for comment. An attorney for Wilson’s B.A.S.S. &amp; M, Inc. and other companies named as debtors also did not respond to requests for comment. A representative of Goldmine didn’t return a request for comment and attempts to reach QCD weren’t successful.\nSavvy scavengers\nWilson began investing in Chicago real estate with her sister and business partner, Swedlana Dass, in 1987, according to a declaration Wilson made as part of the bankruptcy filed in October.\nIn 1989, Wilson’s husband, Michael Wilson, began helping them purchase commercial and residential properties through Cook County’s scavenger and annual tax sales, according to Wilson’s declaration. Back then, scavenger sales were held every two years for properties with taxes that were more than three years behind. Buyers bid on the properties, with bids starting at $250, and the highest bidder won a lien on the property.\nIt’s a little different than Cook County’s annual tax sale, where buyers bid on property tax debt, not the properties themselves — meaning the scavenger sale properties are at an even deeper level of distress. However, if the property owner does not pay their tax debt back to the buyer within a certain period, then tax buyers can file a petition to take over ownership of the property.\nThe tax buyer is still required to pay back any unpaid property taxes remaining on the property if they do take over the deed, though, which is why people looking to acquire land at a low cost typically gravitate more toward scavenger sales, where properties can be sold for even less than their delinquent taxes and interest owed.\n\nWilson was among the investors who used these sales to accumulate a massive amount of land very quickly. She and Dass, through their various companies, acquired over 800 commercial and residential properties over 32 years. The lots have an estimated market value of $17.8 million, according to court filings. Most of the properties are vacant lots, but Wilson did lease some of them to businesses, generating about $290,000 in annual rent revenue, according to her declaration.\nIllinois passed reforms in 2023 that made scavenger sales optional and\nclosed a long-criticized loophole\nthat allowed tax buyers to get refunds should they find a way to claim property was sold in error.\nScavenger sales are “unlikely to be held again” in the county, given the reforms, a Cook County Treasurer’s Office spokesperson said, acknowledging that the sales were a vessel “through which many properties were acquired by investors at low cost.”\n“It’s much more difficult for investors to acquire properties at an annual tax sale because they must pay all back taxes, and in about 95 percent of cases, the taxpayer pays off their tax debt before the investors can take title to the property,” the spokesperson said.\nThe main thing that brought Wilson onto the city’s radar was the sheer volume of code violations she racked up, amassing $15 million in unpaid municipal tickets for dumping garbage on vacant lots and failing to address\nrat infestations\ncaused by the dumping.\nThat affects neighboring residential and commercial buildings as rat infestations spread and run-off from discarded metal products leaches into the soil, Richardson-Lowry said, calling Wilson “the worst offender that we’ve found so far.”\nIt took a while to connect the dots on just how many properties Wilson owned, Richardson-Lowry said. First, they thought it was 200. Then, it was 500. And finally, over 800 properties were found to be owned by Wilson or companies associated with her or Dass.\nWhen Wilson wasn’t responsive to the city’s requests for her to clean up her properties, Holtkamp and his team decided to get serious.\nThree-pronged approach\nFirst, they enforced any preexisting judgements they had against Wilson and her companies in the city’s Department of Administrative Hearings, registering them all as cases with the Circuit Court of Cook County.\nOver 5,000 new complaints were filed against Wilson in Circuit Court, Holtkamp said. They consolidated the cases and pursued them “very, very aggressively,” digging for evidence and freezing bank accounts.\nThen, the city filed separate cases in the Circuit Court to petition a judge for temporary restraining orders requiring Wilson to clean up specific properties immediately, which was successful in some cases, Holtkamp said.\nLast April, for example,\nthe city sued Wilson and her company Regal LLC\n, seeking over $10 million in damages over a vacant lot in the Englewood neighborhood on the South Side. Large stacks of tires dumped on the property were cleaned up in April after the city sent letters notifying Wilson and Regal of the impending litigation,\nIllinois Answers Project reported\n.\nThe final and perhaps most important approach taken by Holtkamp and his team is that they started suing and issuing any new citations not just to the entities that owned each property, but to the people behind them, he said.\nNow, the city is naming the individual owners behind LLCs, whenever possible, as soon as the owner receives a citation with the city.\nThat way, “when we have those judgments and we seek to enforce them, we will be able to freeze their personal assets, and that is quite a motivator,” Holtkamp said.\nThe city is suing Wilson for at least $46 million between the preexisting judgments filed in court and new lawsuits brought by the city, Holtkamp said. But there are other citations still pending, he added.\nWilson’s companies filed for bankruptcy as the lawsuits and fines accumulated. In response, the city accused Wilson and her sister, Dass, of fraud, claiming they hid their wealth by transferring ownership of local properties around to businesses based in South Dakota until their Illinois companies appeared penniless.\nThe city objected to the bankruptcy filing to make sure it was “protected as a creditor and that things would be done appropriately” — an issue that has since been resolved, according to Steve Madura of Hilco Real Estate, who is selling Wilson’s 812 properties.\nThe bankruptcy case is ongoing. Wilson has begun to pay back some of the fines she owes the city, about $1 million so far, Holtkamp said, adding that they “expect to see quite a bit more by the end of sales.”\nProceeds from the sale will also go to repaying Wilson’s debts to two other lenders — Charles L. Walker and New York-based global alternative asset manager Nine Left Capital.\n",

But with construction costs that were already rising even before President Trump’s plans for tariffs took effect, there’s even more uncertainty ahead now for these firms.\nFor\nTRD’s\nThe Closing, landlord Albert Friedman\n, the transformative force behind River North’s rise as an economic engine, breaks down his origins, retail tactics and thoughts on how to fix Chicago’s struggling office market.\nIn Chicago’s suburbs, developer\nMark Meyer’s firm E&amp;M Strategic\nis facing a muddy foreclosure of a $24 million construction loan for a stalled Skokie hotel project that took in public funding and also faces allegations from contractors who say they’ve gone unpaid for their work. Other hotel news includes struggling hospitality firm\nSonder bailing on a lease\nof a River North hotel as its landlord sues for $4 million.\n\nLongtime CRE player\nZaya Younan is fighting against his lender Royal Business Bank’s\nmulti-pronged foreclosure that threatens to strip the landlord of a struggling Arlington Heights office and his luxury home outside Los Angeles. The legal back-and-forth includes some odd arguments.\nChicago’s multifamily market raked in a\n$160 million CMBS refinancing\nfor the 481-unit 540 North State Street. It was a mixed signal, as the deal both shows a level of confidence in the city’s big apartment assets while also requiring the under-the-radar landlord to cover a $16 million debt gap to retire a previous loan taken out when the building notched a higher appraisal a decade ago.\nFinally, the office leasing market got a couple jolts as landlords work to bounce back from the pandemic-induced downturn. Fintech firm\nStripe doubled its office footprint\nat the distressed 350 North Orleans Street tower to around 89,000 square feet, investment firm\nBlue Owl is taking another floor at 150 North Riverside Plaza\n, and law firm Goldman Ismail Tomaselli Brennan &amp; Baum is set to nearly\ndouble the size of its lease\nin a relocation from 200 South Wacker Drive to 191 North Wacker.\n",

    "content": "Investors say real estate crowdfunding platform CrowdStreet helped facilitate a multimillion-dollar fraud by way of a Chicago office building, and now they want a refund.\nA group of 125 investors is taking legal action against the Austin-based investment platform, alleging it facilitated fraud in Nightingale Properties’ $130 million acquisition of 200 West Jackson Boulevard, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nThe investors are demanding $7.2 million in damages from CrowdStreet, plus interest, fees and punitive damages, in a claim filed this week with the Arbitration Service of Portland.\nCrowdStreet failed to do its due diligence on Nightingale and its CEO Elie Schwartz before allowing the firm to raise $25 million for its 2022 purchase of the 29-story tower in the Chicago Loop, the investors claim.\nSchwartz has\nsince pleaded guilty to wire fraud\nfor misappropriating $54 million CrowdStreet funneled to him for failed office deals in\nAtlanta\nand\nMiami Beach\n.\nThe West Jackson investors accuse CrowdStreet of misrepresenting Nightingale’s financial commitment by stating the firm would contribute $11.7 million in equity to the deal. In reality, at least $5.8 million of that capital was never put in, the investors claim.\nNightingale bought the tower for $130 million in January 2022. It was financed with an $86 million CMBS loan from Citibank and a $17 million mezzanine loan from Kawa Capital Management.\n\nThe landlord is up to date on loan payments, and the building was 82 percent leased as of September, according to a letter to investors from CrowdStreet, which said JLL had since taken over operations and control of the property’s bank accounts.\nCrowdStreet knew — or should have known — about Nightingale’s misconduct but continued promoting its deals, investors argue, while granting it “enterprise-level sponsor” status, the platform’s highest designation.\nCrowdStreet dismissed the claims as “meritless” and said it would present its case in arbitration.\nThe latest arbitration follows a separate 2024 claim with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, in which a dozen investors sought to shut down CrowdStreet’s broker-dealer operations after losing $1.5 million in failed Nightingale deals.\nSchwartz caused 800 investors to send about $62.8 million for real estate investments that he diverted for his own use, according to federal prosecutors. He awaits sentencing, facing a maximum of 20 years in prison.\n— Judah Duke",
