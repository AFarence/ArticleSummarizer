    "content": "The Agency’s Mike Fabbri was almost across the finish line on a Downtown Manhattan co-op sale.\nHis buyer, a woman in her 30s, had already signed a contract for the apartment and agreed to pay in cash. All that was left was the board application, a historically arduous process, but he was confident she fit the bill.\nThen came deal-breaking news — his buyer was the proud owner of a cockatoo.\nFabbri scrambled to pull together documentation that might convince the board that a new winged resident wasn’t such a bad idea. He collected letters of recommendation from his buyer’s previous landlord and a friend who used to watch her bird on occasion. Her doctor wrote a note testifying to the bird’s capabilities as an emotional support animal.\nThe co-op board rejected her bid. Boards don’t typically give a reason for their refusal, but given her other qualifications, Fabbri suspects it was the cockatoo.\nIn my time as a reporter, brokers across the city have recounted similar tales, especially when selling Manhattan co-ops, where rules are stringent and even the slightest error on a board package — or a dog teetering on the edge of 50 pounds — can scrap a deal.\nAs prices for co-ops stagnated, and buyers turned increasingly to condos, agents say several boards have\nrelaxed many of their policies\n, allowing buyers to finance more of their purchase or renovate their apartments in months that aren’t June, July or August.\nCould requirements for pets, which appraiser Jonathan Miller\nonce referred to\nas a “dog weighing-in ceremony,” be the next to ease? While most still have weight and breed restrictions, blanket bans on pets are likely near impossible, since the pandemic prompted many New Yorkers to adopt a furry family member.\n“People are not giving up their dogs, even if they love the apartment,” said Brown Harris Stevens’ Lisa Simonsen. “Some people would probably prefer to leave behind a teenager.”\nEven with restrictions still in place, brokers have found ways to skirt around the rules — and it usually involves tacking on a few numbers to the purchase price.\nOne of Simonsen’s buyers was approved to buy a Park Avenue co-op, despite her two 70- to 80-pound hunting dogs.\n“When you get to the point that you’re getting full ask or over ask, they don’t say no so quickly.”\nUnlike Fabbri, other brokers have gotten lucky with the paperwork. About eight years ago, Compass’ Vickey Barron was representing a doctor in the purchase of a co-op on lower Fifth Avenue.\n\nDuring the board interview, a member asked him if anyone would be staying in his apartment, to which he replied, his girlfriend, and potentially her dog. His response sent Barron on a chase to assemble the dog’s vaccination records, adoption papers and anything else she could think of to prove the dog wouldn’t be a problem.\nThe board’s final request was for her buyer to bring the dog in for an interview.\nThe pup must have passed the test because Barron’s buyer got the apartment. But last she checked, he’d lost the girlfriend. And her dog.\nNot so fast…\nThe time for acquisitions is now — at least that’s what Real Trends co-founder Steve Murray\nprophesied on a panel\nat the HousingWire conference almost a year ago. And the latest headlines are proving him right.\nRumors swirled on Thursday that Compass was closing in on a deal to buy Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices. The speculation was all but confirmed in the afternoon when the Wall Street Journal reported that the firms were in\n“advanced talks,”\nthough the story lacked any specifics about the pending sale.\nHomeServices CEO Gino Blefari\nrefuted the reporting\nin an email sent around to franchisees, claiming “no such sale is being contemplated.”\nTales of the alleged acquisition came just months after Compass purchased @properties and Christie’s International Real Estate,\na $444 million sale\nthat sent shockwaves across the industry. In New York City, Compass and the local BHHS affiliate were both among the\ntop brokerages\nby sales volume in 2023, with Compass holding the No.2 spot with $5 billion in sell-side deals and BHHS in 18th with just under $100 million.\nIn the first two weeks of March, other major national brokerages have announced deals of their own. Keller Williams Realty, the largest brokerage by agent count, sold\na significant stake\nto Stone Point Capital, the parent company of CoreLogic. Earlier this week, mortgage firm Rocket Companies\npaid $1.75 billion\nto acquire Redfin.\nWith two deals in the books before the end of the first quarter, signs are pointing toward more acquisitions in the year to come — even if Compass buying BHHS isn’t one of them.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nActress Grace Hightower sold the Central Park West co-op she shared with her ex-husband, Robert De Niro, for\n$18 million\nin the priciest deal to close in the city this week. The couple bought the apartment at 88 Central Park West for $21 million almost two decades ago.\nThe home, which De Niro and Hightower renovated after a fire in 2012, has five bedrooms, views of Central Park and an eat-in kitchen.\n",

    "content": "The residential real estate world has been in the spin cycle in the last 24 hours.\nA bombshell report from the\nWall Street Journal\nThursday said Compass, the country’s largest real estate brokerage, was\nnearing a deal to acquire\nBerkshire Hathaway’s real estate arm, HomeServices of America.\nBut HomeServices CEO Gino Blefari\ndenied the report in a memo\nreleased hours later to employees.\n“I want to confirm to you that there are no discussions, negotiations, or agreements to sell HomeServices or any of its affiliated companies, and that includes the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices franchise business,” Blefari wrote, adding that “no such sale is being contemplated.”\nThe statement was a sharp pivot from the picture of “advanced talks” that made headlines, but weren’t enough to shut down the possibility of a deal materializing.\nAn acquisition, even one of such staggering proportions, would be\nin line with Compass’ ambitions\nfor market share and inventory. Compass, for its part, stayed quiet amid the mixed messaging, leaving the industry with more questions than answers.\nThe Berkshire perspective\nBlefari himself has acknowledged that he’s not always in the know when it comes to Berkshire Hathaway’s inner workings.\nHe told Housingwire in 2021 that he hadn’t spoken to Berkshire Hathaway’s CEO Warren Buffett in years, and that the trillion-dollar conglomerate’s performance doesn’t bleed into his brokerage’s operations. In that same interview, he also criticized Compass for not competing on a “level playing field” with its investor-fueled bonuses and lucrative splits.\nAny deal for the real estate arm would still be executed by Buffett’s firm, and there’s a chance that Blefari just hadn’t been clued in yet. Blefari has not responded to texts for comment, and an automatic email response said he was traveling for business for the remainder of the week.\nBut the deal would still be out of character for Buffett, who has a stated aversion to selling subsidiaries.\n“Berkshire almost never sells controlled businesses unless we face what we believe to be unending problems,” he wrote in a 2024 shareholder\nletter\n.\n\nA sale of HomeServices now would also run counter to Buffett’s guiding ethos of buying low and selling high, and likely signal Buffett’s long-term pessimism about the real estate market or Berkshire’s ability to compete in it.\nThe brokerage business was consistently profitable, making $160 million in 2019, $375 million in 2020 and $381 million in 2021. But after barely breaking in 2023, HomeServices lost $107 million in 2024, which it attributed to an industry downturn and settlement payments related to the Sitzer/Burnett antitrust lawsuit.\nThe real estate industry has suffered some of its worst years in recent memory as a result of high interest rates and the surge of buying and selling that came in the aftermath of the pandemic. But real estate is cyclical, and a sale now would likely not be maximizing HomeServices’s value.\nAn analyst who covers Compass also raised the possibility that the deal is not for the entire brokerage, but for pieces under its umbrella.\nThe Compass perspective\nThe deal, while shocking in its scale, is in line with the M&amp;A warpath Compass has been on in the past 12 months. At a recent investor day, Compass CEO Robert Reffkin noted the company’s strong M&amp;A momentum, albeit with a nod toward its appetite for smaller brokerages.\nThe firm’s biggest move came when it announced a $444 million deal for @properties and Christie’s International Real Estate towards the end of last year. The deals are part of the brokerage’s efforts to get up to 30 percent market share in its top 30 markets in the next five years.\nThis acquisition would be its largest to date. HomeServices is the fourth-largest brokerage in the country, with $4.4 billion in revenue last year compared to Compass’ $5.6 billion.\nBy total transaction volume, HomeServices is more than six times as large as @properties.\nBringing on HomeServices would also help grow Compass’ ancillary businesses, said Finley Hair, national director of M&amp;A Advisory at WAV Group, something that brokerages are increasingly focused on to combat their thin margins.\nA massive acquisition would be in good company on the residential consolidation front. This week, Rocket Companies announced a $1.75 billion deal to acquire Redfin, and earlier this year Keller Williams announced it was\nselling a majority stake\nto private equity firm Stone Point Capital.\nCompass has been pushing its off-MLS inventory, which only grows more valuable the larger it gets, and other companies may be seeing the writing on the wall.\n“There’s one thing that has never changed in the real estate business,” Hair said.  “He who controls the inventory, controls the market — Robert Reffkin understands that, and that’s what he’s going after.”",

    "content": "Waiting for a new Penn Station is a little like waiting for a train at Penn Station.\nYou are standing in the NJ Transit train hall, neck craned back slightly to stare down a screen that promises your train is “on time.” A small number will appear next to your train, telling you where to catapult your body to join a swarm of commuters competing to squeeze onto the tiny escalator that will deliver you to your train.\nBut the number never appears, despite an automated voice that tells you the train is pulling up to the station. You get an alert on your phone that says all trains are suspended in and out of Penn because someone sneezed near some Amtrak signal cables. Or NJ Transit needs to investigate the sneeze; it is unclear. You know that no trains are coming, but that automated, female voice keeps informing you, over and over, that phantom trains are pulling up to the station.\nThat disembodied voice is a little like the announcements that the state is kick-starting a plan to redevelop Penn Station. You hear it, you want to believe it and then you wait and nothing happens.\nI’ve been covering this project for the past 10 years, and in that time, the state has reintroduced the project at least five times. Many visions, by both the state and outside groups, have been pitched during that time.\nThis week Grand Penn Alliance, a group backed by hedge fund manager and Republican donor Thomas Klingenstein,\naccording to Gothamist\n, reupped a proposal it introduced in 2023. The plan calls for moving Madison Square Garden to the former Hotel Penn site, and building a park on the former arena site. Renderings show a classical facade, new train hall and single-level concourse. Last week Assembly member Tony Simone\npitched\nrevising plans for a megadevelopment surrounding the station to include more housing and a park on the Hotel Penn site.\nWe’re still waiting on the state to announce its next move on redesigning Penn Station and whether Gov. Kathy Hochul’s meeting with President Donald Trump on Friday will help get things moving. We’ve been on standby for decades, and this train will not pull into the station until funding is lined up for the project.\nWhat we’re thinking about\n: What is going on with\nBerkshire Hathaway HomeServices and Compass\n? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we’ve learned\n: Mets owner Steve Cohen’s casino project, which his press people will no doubt remind us should be referred to as Metropolitan Park, this week\ngot the rezoning\nit needs from the City Council, Gothamist reports. That was not a surprise, because the local Council member, Francisco Moya, supports the plan.\nCohen’s main obstacle is getting parkland alienation from the state legislature, because the local state senator, Sen. Jessica Ramos, doesn’t want a casino in her district.\n\nIt’s possible that the legislature will alienate the parkland over her objections, but that is rare for Albany. If ever an exception would be made, it would be for something like this. The parkland is really just a parking lot. —\nErik Engquist\nElsewhere in New York…\n— President Donald Trump hinted Thursday that he may seek Gov. Kathy Hochul’s approval of a controversial pipeline as part of discussions that include congestion pricing and the redevelopment of Penn Station,\nGothamist reports\n. The so-called Constitution Pipeline would stretch 124 miles through New York’s Southern Tier and western Catskills.\n— City health officials say two pet cats died after being infected with bird flu,\nthe New York Times reports\n. The cause of the infections was not clear, though potential sources include unpasteurized milk, contact with infected birds and infected food.\n— Last month Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado announced that he will not seek re-election next year. Now, it seems he’s preparing to run for something else.\nCity &amp; State reports\nthat Delgado spoke at New York Somos in Albany last weekend and delivered “stump speech-sounding remarks.” He did not attend Hochul’s private reception at the Executive Mansion.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Friday was\n$15.6 million\nfor a condo unit at 535 West End Avenue. The Upper West Side condo is 6,600 square feet. The unit was last sold in 2013 for $16.3 million.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$161.3 million\nfor 334-342 Madison Avenue. The 22-story office building was sold at auction after RXR’s Scott Rechler defaulted on a\n$315 million\nmortgage on the building.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $7.2 million for 160 Leroy Street. The West Village condo is 2,000 square feet.\nDouglas Elliman’s\nArlene Gutterson has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 66,886-square-foot, 12-story residential building at 10 Van Cortlandt Avenue East in the Bronx. The development site sold last year for nearly $5 million. Saky Yakas of SLCE Architects is the applicant of record.\n— Joseph Jungermann",

    "content": "Will the Las Vegas Sands, owners of the Dallas Mavericks, manage to legalize gambling in Texas this legislative session?\nNot if a coalition of freshmen in the Texas House of Representatives gets its way. Twelve Republican lawmakers who replaced pro-gambling politicians in the last election are holding the line against casinos, the Texas Tribune\nreported\n. They are joined by three others who voted in favor of sports betting last session but have since rescinded their support.\nThey said this week they would oppose “any attempt to expand gambling” this session, which ends in May. After that, the Texas Legislature won’t meet in regular session again until 2027.\nProposals to legalize casinos and sports betting have been introduced, but the GOP coalition aims to stop them in their tracks. Neither proposal has received a committee hearing, the first step to consideration by the full house.\nThat could be bad news for the city of Irving, where Sands is seeking zoning approval for a Mavericks stadium with a resort and entertainment center, including a casino. Sands is spending big on lobbying and advertising campaigns in favor of “destination resort” casinos. If a casino is a no-go, Sands has said it is\nlikely to kill the entire proposal\n.\nMeanwhile in Southern Dallas, developer\nHoque Global\nmet its first deadline in its agreement with the city of Dallas for its University Hills megadevelopment. The firm now has\n60 days to purchase\nthe 270 acres for the development.\nOne of Fort Worth’s biggest development players,\nCrescent Real Estate\n, shifted its C-suite with the appointment of\nConrad Suszynski\nas sole CEO following the retirement of co-CEO Jason Anderson. Fort Worth is undergoing a development boom that is touching a beloved antique mall near the Cultural District, where\nPhoenix Property Company\nis planning a\n12-story hotel\n, plus retail and multifamily.\n\nIn office leasing news, the flight-to-quality trend reeled in some big fish.\nLaw firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom leased 52,000 square feet spanning two full floors in\nHines’\nTexas Tower\nin Houston. The lease brings the building, at 845 Texas Avenue to 99 percent leased.\nAnother law firm, Hicks Johson, is spending $4.3 million to build out its lease at\nSkanska’s\nNorton Rose Fullbright tower at 1550 Lamar Street, which is\ndowntown Houston’s newest\noffice building.\nAnd a retail merchandiser is\nmoving its headquarters\nto 5801 Headquarters Drive in Plano, owned by\nMonarch Alternative Capital\nand\nTourmaline Capital Partners\nand built in 2021. The company will exit Granite Properties’ Granite Park III, which was built in 2007.\nAnd in Austin, Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms is spending $3.7 million on an\noffice buildout in downtown Austin\n, although it’s not clear for whom.\n—Rachel Stone\n",

    "content": "State Farm General got its wish to hike home insurance rates by an average of 22 percent.\nThe news comes weeks after being\nstraight-armed\nby California’s chief insurance regulator for a request to increase rates because of the Los Angeles wildfires.\nCalifornia Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara “provisionally” granted the unit of Illinois-based State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance the emergency rate increase requested after billions in wildfire claims,\nthe Los Angeles Times reported\n.\nBut the increase — which includes a 38 percent rate increase for rental buildings and 15 percent for renters and condo owners — won’t take effect until a hearing slated for April 8.\nLara approved the increase on March 14 after\nturning down the request last month\n, saying the insurer had failed to prove it was warranted.\nHe’d given the insurer an opportunity, however, to provide more evidence to justify the request.\nIn making his decision, Lara called on State Farm to halt any pending nonrenewals of customers statewide and for the insurer’s parent company to provide its California insurer an infusion of $500 million to stabilize its capital position, according to the Times.\n“The role of insurance commissioner involves balancing a stable and sustainable insurance market that serves consumers with effective oversight,” he said in a statement. “To ensure long-term choices for Californians, I had to make an unprecedented decision in the short term.”\n“The facts will be revealed in an open, transparent hearing,” he added.\n\nState Farm has faced years of losses and huge damage claims after the\nJan. 7 fires\nthat raged Pacific Palisades to Altadena, and leveled more than 12,000 homes.\nAs of March 11, State Farm General and its parent have received more than 12,000 fire and auto claims related to the wildfires, and paid\nmore than $2.2 billion to customers\n.\nState Farm General has estimated it will pay out $7.9 billion in the wake of the Palisades, Eaton and other L.A. County fires.\nBut, its net losses from the fires will be closer to $600 million after reinsurance payments, which largely will come from its parent company. Reinsurance is bought by insurers from other insurers to protect themselves from catastrophic events.\nLast March, the company announced it would\nnot renew 72,000 home, apartment and other property policies\nin California, citing wildfire risks and other concerns.\nThat followed a\ndecision in May 2023\nto stop writing insurance for new businesses, homeowners, and other personal property and casualties in the state, with the exception of personal auto policies.\nIn June, State Farm\nrequested a 30 percent rate increase for its homeowners policies\n, as well as other rate hikes, which await a decision. The request took state officials by surprise, with Lara saying it raised “serious questions about its financial condition.”\nState Farm General last month said it’s lost $2.8 billion over the last nine years, including gains from investment income. State Farm Group, led by State Farm General’s parent company, was given a superior financial rating in December by a rating agency.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Once a retail mecca for greater Phoenix, the mall slid into decline and closed in 2018. It was razed in 2023.\nVerde is seeking partners to advance the redevelopment.\n“We are aware that Verde Investments is actively marketing the land to potential developers,” Mesa City Manager Chris Brady told the Business Journal in a statement. “We’ve had conversations with national and regional developers who have expressed interest in the site’s potential.\n“While no deal has materialized yet, we are confident it is a matter of time for a developer to present a proposal that will bring jobs and offer quality mixed-use development.”\nVerde Investments, a holding company founded in 1992 by Garcia, invests in commercial properties. Its Verde Outdoor owns more than 1,200 billboards across the U.S.\nGarcia is the\nlargest shareholder\nof Tempe-based Carvana, a sub-prime lender and online retailer of used cars, and owns DriveTime Automotive, a used-car dealership in Phoenix.

    "content": "State insurance regulators have unveiled a new plan to stabilize the home insurance market by pushing insurers to expand coverage in fire-prone areas where companies have dropped hundreds of thousands of homeowners in recent years.\nThe plan updates a map of high-risk zip codes where insurers will be required to write more policies, aiming to create a more equitable insurance market despite growing wildfire threats, the\nSan Jose Mercury News reported\n.\nHowever, many high-risk Bay Area neighborhoods, including Oakland, the Berkeley Hills and Gilroy, aren’t included in the updated map.\nState regulators say this is because those areas fall within zip codes where the overall insurance need is deemed lower. Despite this, new rules will still require insurers to offer coverage to homeowners in these areas who have been rejected by traditional providers due to fire risk.\n“Insurance companies have ignored those homes, and we’re trying to put the spotlight on them,” Michael Soller, spokesperson for the California Department of Insurance, told the Mercury News.\nThe plan stems from a deal with the insurance industry, allowing companies to raise rates based on climate-related risks in exchange for expanding coverage in high-risk areas.\nCalifornians currently pay an average of $1,435 annually for homeowners insurance, below the national average. But prices vary widely. And insurers like State Farm and Allstate have stopped issuing new policies in the state, citing strict rate-setting rules and wildfire losses.\nThe new rules require insurers to cover a proportional share of high-risk policies. For example, if a company covers 100 of every 1,000 policies statewide, it must cover 85 of every 1,000 in high-risk areas.\n\nHowever, some consumer groups argue the reforms have loopholes that may allow insurers to delay meeting these targets or only slightly increase coverage.\nHomeowners in fire-prone areas, like Carolyn Grote of the Berkeley Hills, are preparing independently. Grote formed a “Firewise community” with neighbors to improve fire safety, hoping to retain her insurance.\n“If Firewise could help people retain their insurance, that might be the biggest motivator,” she told the newspaper.\nConsumer groups are skeptical.\n“Insurers can use secret models to raise rates right away with unenforceable promises to expand coverage,” Carmen Balber of nonprofit Consumer Watchdog told the Mercury News.\nRegulators, however, insist they will monitor compliance closely and can revoke rate-setting privileges if insurers fail to meet coverage requirements.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Forever 21 is preparing to potentially close hundreds of stores, including more than a dozen in Southern California, as part of its ongoing bankruptcy.\nThe Los Angeles-based apparel firm, hurt by plunging sales and competition from overseas e-commerce merchants, will make cuts across Los Angeles and Orange counties,\nthe Orange County Register reported.\nThe pending closures come after the 41-year-old company l\nocked the doors of its Downtown L.A. headquarters\nlast month at the California Market Center at 110 East 9th Street, in the Fashion District.\nAfter decades of family ownership, the retail chain was sold in 2020 to investors who now seek a new owner.\nThe company is preparing to close down its remaining 350 stories as part of its bankruptcy filing,\naccording to Bloomberg\n, citing anonymous sources.\nEfforts to find a buyer for the fast-fashion retailer to avoid a liquidation have so far failed, they said. Talks with one potential bidder are ongoing\nForever 21 reported to the state it would be closing eight stores across Southern California — but the closures appear to be more widespread, with hundreds of employees to hit the bricks, according to the Register.\nThe official closures include stores at the The Outlets at Orange, Main Place Mall in Santa Ana, Galleria at Tyler Mall in Riverside, Ontario Mills in Ontario, Victoria Gardens in Rancho Cucamonga, Montclair Place in Montclair, Lakewood Center Mall and at Los Cerritos Mall\nThe company said the layoffs and store closures are permanent, beginning April 25 and continuing through May 9, letters submitted to California’s Employment Development Department.\n\nReaders of the Register also reported stores at Westfield Fashion Square in Sherman Oaks, The Shops at Santa Anita in Arcadia, South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, Promenade Temecula and Inland Center in San Bernardino had closing signs on their storefront windows.\nThe company,\nwith 58 stores in California\n, announced in February that it would shutter at least 200 stores nationwide.\nThe retailer was founded in 1984 by husband and wife Do Won and Jin Sook Chang as Fashion 21, in Los Angeles, with its first store on Figueroa Street.\nRenamed Forever 21, the chain grew into a nationwide brand known for its trendy and cheap clothing for teens and 20-somethings. At its peak in 2015, the company reported $4.4 billion in sales and 1,300 stores worldwide.\nBut over the years, the company faced numerous controversies, including accusations of wage theft, the use of cadmium in its jewelry, controversial slogans on T-shirts and the cheap labor used abroad to sew its clothing.\nIn 2020, its assets were sold in bankruptcy for $81 million to a group of investors that included Authentic Brands Group, Simon Properties and Brookfield Properties. That group, known as SPARC, owned retail brands including Lucky, Eddie Bauer, Aeropostale, Brooks Brothers and Nautica.\nIn January, SPARC said\nit was merging with JCPenney\n, creating a new group called Catalyst Brands, which left off Forever 21 from its list of brands. Instead, the company said it was seeking a new operator for the retailer.\nToday, fast fashion in the U.S. has been overrun with competition from Chinese e-commerce companies such as Temu and Shein, which produce and sell items for pennies, according to the Register.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Hines, Chris Kennedy of a famous American political family and their investment partners in a 60-story skyscraper in Chicago have defied the pandemic-induced downturn for commercial office space.\nThe owners of\nSalesforce Tower\non the bank of the Chicago River are nearing the finalization of a $610 million long-term debt deal, marking a milestone in the aftermath of the pandemic-stricken economy, CoStar News\nreported\n. Should the deal close later this month as expected, the property — developed by Hines and the Kennedy family as well as the AFL-CIO’s real estate investment arm — will stand as a contrarian bet that worked out amid economic uncertainty.\nThe commercial mortgage-backed securities loan reflects the tower’s long-term valuation of $888 million, as appraised by Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Its current valuation of $745 million is expected to rise further following the repayment of tenant-improvement costs and free rent allowances.\nThe refinancing package, with Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs serving as the lenders, will replace the property’s $549 million construction debt and is projected to carry an interest rate of 6.525 percent until its maturity in March 2030.\nConceived during the early days of the pandemic, Salesforce Tower has upended market trends by maintaining high occupancy levels, with leases covering over 95 percent of its 1.2 million square feet. Key tenants include Salesforce, which rents more than 477,000 square feet, and Kirkland &amp; Ellis, which is on a 677,000-square-foot lease; those deals run into the 2040s.\n\nMeanwhile, much of the rest of the Chicago office market is depressed, with record-high vacancy rates of more than 25 percent and\nmassive foreclosure lawsuits\nagainst office landlords winding through Cook County court.\nFor the Salesforce Tower developers and Chicago’s broader office market, scoring the loan is a testament to the investment thesis that the world’s largest companies remain interested in ultra-premium workspace and aren’t afraid to invest heavily in it as a method to attract and retain top talent. Kirkland has poured over $207 million beyond its tenant-improvement allowance to create its ideal workspaces, while Salesforce has put up an additional $78 million for its interior buildout, the Moody’s report cited by the outlet shows.\nMoody’s put out a robust outlook on the deal, buoyed by a net operating income projected to reach about $51.2 million by the second year of the loan.\nEastdil Secured arranged the financing package for Salesforce Tower.\n",

    "content": "Landlords in Los Angeles and Orange counties have jacked up rents at more than twice the national rate since a firestorm early this year torched more than 12,000 homes.\nRents in January and February rose 0.7 percent across the region — more than double the 0.3 percent increases for apartments nationwide and locally during the same period,\nthe Orange County Register reported\n, citing a report\nfrom ApartmentList.\nRents rose across Los Angeles as thousands of refugees from fire-scorched neighborhoods scrambled to find places to live.\nMonthly rents in Santa Monica, near the Palisades fire, are up 3 percent year to date, with a typical two-bedroom unit renting for $2,867.\nRents in Glendale, near the Eaton fire, are up 2.1 percent, with a typical two-bedroom home renting for $2,462 a month. At the same time, rents in January and February rose 2 percent in Pasadena to $2,731, and 1.9 percent in Burbank to $2,448.\nDespite government actions to cap rent hikes, “the fires could still have a meaningful impact on rent prices in a market where metro-wide rent growth had previously been essentially flat,” ApartmentList’s report stated.\n“Increases are relatively modest so far and do not indicate evidence of widespread rent gouging but they do seem to indicate that the trajectory of the area’s rent prices has been altered by the fires.”\n\nAn analysis by the Washington Post after the fires found that landlords had illegally gouged renters scrambling to find homes, with rents jumping by\n20 percent across Los Angeles County.\nIn nearly 30 cities and Los Angeles neighborhoods, the median rent for homes listed within two weeks after the fires started spiked well\npast the legal limit of 10 percent\n, compared with those listed within two weeks before the blazes\nAn executive order signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom after the fires began made it illegal to jack up the cost of hotels, housing, gas and other goods by more than 10 percent.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\nKEY POINTS:\n",

    "content": "The First Amendment may not save O Cinema from getting evicted for screening an Oscar winning documentary about the Gaza War and events that led to it.\nOn Wednesday, the\nMiami Beach\nCity Commission will consider Mayor Steven Meiner’s request to terminate O Cinema’s lease for a movie theater space inside a city-owned historic building at 1130 Washington Avenue, as well as end roughly $40,000 in grants to the nonprofit arthouse.\nMeiner moved to kick out O Cinema after it went ahead with sold-out showings of “No Other Land,” a film about the ongoing conflict between Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank. Directed by Palestinian activist Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham, “No Other Land” won best documentary feature at this year’s Academy Awards.\nIn a newsletter to his constituents, Meiner called the film “a false one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our City and residents.”\nMeiner and city officials did not respond to requests for comment. O Cinema co-founder Kareem Tabsch told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the nonprofit art house is ready to pursue “all courses to allow us to continue operating in Miami Beach.”\n“We haven’t ruled out what those measures would be,” Tabsch said. “I think it is very clear that when we decided to continue showing this film, [Meiner] introduced a resolution to pull our funding and cancel the lease.”\nO Cinema is getting legal counsel from the Florida chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and Community Justice Project, “ Tabsch added.\nWhile some civil libertarians believe Miami Beach officials would be violating O Cinema’s right to free speech by evicting the theater, the lease terms favor the city, according to commercial real estate experts.\n\nA copy of the agreement obtained by\nThe Real Deal\nshows that the city can terminate the lease “without cause and without liability to the landlord” as long as O Cinema is given 180 days prior written notice. O Cinema’s five-year lease expired last year, but in April the city commission approved the tenant’s option to renew for another two years, city records show.\n“To the extent it can be shown that canceling the lease was based [on the content of “No Other Land,”] there would be a First Amendment violation claim,” said Miami-based attorney Mitchell Jagodinski. “The question for the court would be whether the operator of the theater waived this claim via the lease contract.”\nJagodinski is representing the developers of\nMiami Wilds\n, a canceled mixed-use project in unincorporated southwest Miami-Dade County that planned to feature a water park, 200-room hotel and 20,000 square feet of restaurants. Last year, Miami-Dade sued Mami Wilds to terminate a 2022 lease agreement to build the project on 66 acres of county-owned land.\nMiami Wilds\ncountersued by alleging Miami-Dade Mayor Danielle Levine Cava violated the developers’ rights by allegedly killing the deal to appease environmental groups and boost her reelection chances.\nO Cinema likely waived a First Amendment claim by agreeing to the city’s “termination for convenience” clause, Jagodinski said. “It essentially gives the city full control to just cancel [the lease] whenever they want for whatever reason,” he explained. “[O Cinema] agreed to this type of situation eventually happening.”\nMiami Beach\nelected officials are definitely within their purview to end the business relationship with O Cinema, said Jose Smith, a former city attorney for Miami Beach and North Miami Beach who also served on the Miami Beach City Commission from 1997 to 2005.\n“I have not seen the entire documentary or the city’s lease with O Cinema,” Smith said via text. “However, the First Amendment does not require the city to permit its tenant, in a city owned venue, to espouse anti-Semitic, hateful, one-sided propaganda, or to be subsidized by the city for doing so.”\nYet, Norman Powell, a North Bay Village-based real estate lawyer who is also the city attorney for\nMiramar\n, isn’t convinced the city of Miami Beach’s “termination for convenience” clause would trump a potential First Amendment violation claim by O Cinema.\n“It’s clear that the mayor’s primary reason for terminating the lease is because he doesn’t like this documentary being played there,” Powell said. “The basis for termination is really not for convenience. It’s being terminated to stifle free speech.”",

    "content": "For some New York City property owners, there’s still not enough incentive to limit carbon emissions.\nDozens of landlords are planning to pay fines for failing to comply with Local Law 97, rather than retrofit their properties to reduce emissions, according to responses by more than two dozen building sector executives to the Center for an Urban Future\nreported\nby Crain’s.\nSome owners think the bottom line looks better if they absorb the fines that will be levied against them for failing to meet decarbonization goals dictated by the law. Retrofitting properties’ lighting, insulation and various systems can be a costly endeavor in itself.\n“It’s a tough sell,” Center for an Urban Future policy director Eli Dvorkin told Crain’s. “For many building owners, it just comes down to pretty basic math, and right now the payback period for those investments is long and getting longer with higher interest rates and rising costs for borrowing.”\nBuilding owners are set to pay $268 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions that exceeds a property’s 2024 limit, varying by building. Owners are required to file reports with the city by Mary to demonstrate compliance; emission reduction targets are set to grow at the end of the decade.\nSo far, a vast majority of buildings required to meet emissions targets are in compliance with the law. The Department of Buildings claims fewer than 11 percent are out of compliance with 2024-26 emissions targets.\n\nTo ensure future compliance, however, Dvorkin suggested the city may need to\nimpose higher fees\nfor violating the decarbonization law, something the Real Estate Board of New York opposes.\nAnother possibility is for the city to increase incentives and financial assistance to help property owners comply with the law, such as providing additional funds and tax credits.\n“The green economy isn’t just going to build itself,” Dvorkin added.\nThe aim of Local Law 97 is for the city to cut emissions 40 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050 from 2005 levels.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "SAJ Development wants to swing a wrecking ball into three office buildings in Lafayette to erect a 90-unit apartment building in an upscale city long opposed to affordable housing.\nThe locally based developer filed revised plans to replace the offices with a seven-story, 171,400-square-foot complex at 1001 Oak Hill Road,\nthe San Francisco Business Times reported\n. The city will consider the project on March 17.\nThe application came as housing advocates\nsued the East Bay city\nfor creating “misleading and unrealistic housing sites” to satisfy state-mandated housing goals. The lawsuit by the Housing Action Coalition accused Lafayette of “pretending” to comply with the state housing element, a planning blueprint required of every city and county across the state every eight years.\nLafayette’s alleged shell game includes relying on faith-based institutions and longtime businesses with no plans to develop housing as potential building sites for homes, according to the complaint.\nThe lawsuit seeks a court to compel the city to adopt a revised plan with an update to its zoning laws. The city must rezone to build 2,114 homes, 943 of them affordable, by 2031. Within the decade through 2019, the city permitted 115 homes.\nSAJ could help remedy that by its mixed-use project calling for 79 market-rate apartments and 11 affordable apartments, including five for very-low-income households and six for moderate-income households.\nWhat appears to be a U-shaped complex, designed by Berkeley-based Trachtenberg Architects, would be draped in two shades of brown, with tiered roof decks, and floor-to-ceiling corner windows with exterior balconies, according to a rendering.\nThe developer would employ a nearly 23 percent state density bonus in exchange for the affordable housing, plus a state streamlining law for faster approvals. A cost and timeline for construction were not disclosed.\n\nSAJ applied using Senate Bill 330, which effectively freezes zoning that’s in place at the time a project is submitted, limits the number of public hearings to five and suspends or eliminates restrictions on housing development.\nThe law aims to prevent cities from delaying projects unnecessarily over subjective standards, along with several other laws meant to stop cities from blocking affordable housing.\nThe developer had submitted an earlier version of the project in 2022 that called for tearing down just two of the three offices to build\n53 units\n. City officials approved that version in May, before SAJ revised its plans. Jeff Stone, owner of Diamond Construction, was listed as the property owner operating through SAJ Development, according to SFYimby.\nLafayette was once a battleground for the region’s housing wars, with two lawsuits, a ballot referendum and more than 100 public hearings that delayed a 315-unit apartment building for almost a dozen years.\nLast year, the\nstate Supreme Court declined\nto hear an appeal from a neighborhood group, allowing the development to move forward. The project has not broken ground.\nMembership in SAJ Development, led by Stone, includes Diamond Swope Holdings, the Steven Kay Trust, the Griggs Community Property Trust and Outdo, based in Lafayette, according to state business records. Another firm, Valley Oak Capital, is based in Texas.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "The developer with ambitious plans for the Bronzeville Lakefront put pictures with its pitch for a Chicago Bears stadium, although the team’s plans are far from certain.\nFarpoint Development released renderings for a $3.2 billion domed stadium on the 49-acre site of the former Michael Reese hospital on the South Side, aiming to present an alternative to the team’s two other options, Crain’s\nreported\n. The team is also considering a redevelopment of the Arlington Heights racetrack and a domed stadium near Soldier Field.\nThe Bronzeville pitch includes an entertainment district, hotels and a 20-acre park bridging over Lake Shore Drive, connecting the stadium to the lakefront, proximity to which has been one of the National Football League team’s main requirements.\nThe developer argues the site offers the best of both worlds: an urban core location and room for ancillary developments — retail, dining and multifamily projects — that could generate additional revenue for the team.\nThe stadium would be privately financed by the Bears, but the developer is pitching $600 million in state infrastructure funds to prepare the site for development, including utilities, roads and environmental work.\nThat departs from\nthe Bears’ other lakefront proposal\n, which sought a $900 million upfront public subsidy. By financing the stadium privately, developers see the plan as more palatable to political leaders wary of direct public subsidies.\n\nStill, hurdles remain. The Bears haven’t publicly engaged with the proposal as of late, but\nrescinded a rejection in the fall\nafter Farpoint updated its plans to take out a conflict with Metra tracks it previously planned to build over.\nInsiders suggest the team is still focused on either advancing its lakefront vision or moving forward in Arlington Heights. The narrow footprint of the Michael Reese site has also raised concerns about feasibility.\nAnother complication is the adjacent Prairie Shores apartment complex, partially owned by Farpoint. The developer says the stadium could fit without impacting the complex, but demolishing units has been floated as a way to maximize the site — an option that would likely draw political pushback.\nThe city still owns the majority of the site and would need to contribute land, as well as cover about $40 million in debt tied to its acquisition. Public financing could also come from tax increment financing and leveraging the site’s federal opportunity zone status.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "Houston’s largest landowners include homebuilders carving out new suburbs and public entities managing flood zones and parks.\nThe top 10 landowners control about 2.6 percent of the metro, the Houston Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe ranking was compiled based on an analysis of Harris, Montgomery, Liberty, Fort Bend, Brazoria, Galveston and Chambers counties, calculating acreage totals from public property records and mapping data and ranking by parcel totals.\nIt offers a snapshot of the region’s most influential landholders shaping development patterns in and around the Houston metro.\nPrivate developers dominate the landscape, with Camillo Companies leading the pack.\nThe Houston-based homebuilder owns 3,650 acres across six counties, supporting the development of 11,222 residential lots under its brands, including SimplyHome and Legend Homes.\nAnother major player, Arlington-based D.R. Horton, holds 3,490 acres. As Houston’s most active homebuilder in 2023, it led the region with 5,570 home starts and continues expanding in suburban communities.\nMeanwhile, Colony Ridge controls nearly 15,000 acres, primarily in Liberty County. The firm, known for developing infrastructure-ready lots, remains a major driver of suburban sprawl despite facing\nscrutiny over its business practices\n.\n\nPublic entities are also prominent landholders. The City of Houston manages 31,530 acres, including major public assets like George Bush Intercontinental Airport, parklands and municipal facilities. The Harris County Flood Control District controls 26,000 acres for its role in flood mitigation efforts.\nThe role of public entities in flood mitigation is particularly crucial, the Bayou City’s low-lying topography and history of major flooding events making infrastructure and water management far more important to long-term development planning relative to most other Texas metros.\nHarris County itself holds 30,130 acres, spanning government buildings, recreational spaces and major event venues like NRG Park.\nHouston’s sprawl is driven by a mix of public investment and private development, with much of the metro’s expansion occurring along major growth corridors like Interstate 45, U.S. Highway 59 and the Grand Parkway.\nLiberty County, where Colony Ridge dominates, is one of the fastest-growing exurban areas, driven by demand for affordable housing. Its population increased 25.5 percent from mid-2020 to last summer, Census data shows.\nMeanwhile, Fort Bend and Montgomery counties continue to attract large-scale master-planned communities, fueled by population growth and proximity to Houston’s employment centers.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "Gracie Abrams is the latest star-studded buyer at a Greenwich Village co-op.\nThe 25-year-old singer-songwriter paid $5.5 million for a penthouse at 1 Fifth Avenue, according to public records. The deal, which appears to be all-cash, works out to about $3,000 per square foot.\nThe nearly-200-unit building, blocks away from Washington Square Park, is\nknown for housing celebrities\nlike the Rolling Stones’ Keith Richards and filmmaker Tim Burton and his ex-wife, actress Helena Bonham Carter.\nAbrams’ new apartment, Unit 18GK, spans roughly 2,000 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. It also features three terraces and views of the park and downtown Manhattan.\nThe co-op last traded for $7 million in 2008.\n\nSotheby’s International’s Martine Capdevielle and Brigitte Goldenberg had the listing.\nCapdevielle said the apartment would likely need a renovation, but declined to comment on the details of the sale.\nAmenities at the Art Deco co-op include full-time doormen and building staff. The landmarked building was designed by architect Harvey Wiley Corbett and built in 1927. It served as a hotel for wealthy artists until it was converted to a co-op in 1976.\nAward-winning actress Jessica Lange bought a ninth-floor unit at the building for $3.4 million in 2005, and more than a decade later,\npurchased the apartment\ndirectly above hers for $3.3 million.\nKeith Richards and his wife, Patti Hensen, sold their duplex penthouse at the co-op in 2018 for $9 million — roughly\n$1 million less\nthan they paid for it four years earlier. The couple initially tried to offload their pad for more than $12 million.\n",

    "content": "Affordable housing developer Lewis Swezy plans an 80-unit age-restricted apartment project near the Earlington Heights Metrorail stop in Miami-Dade County.\nSwezy, through his Miami Lakes-based Centennial Management, wants to develop the six-story building with 60 one-bedroom apartments and 20 two-bedroom apartments on a 0.7-acre site at 4052 Northwest 22nd Avenue in an unincorporated area of the county, according to an application submitted to Miami-Dade this week. It will include rooftop amenities, 800 square feet of commercial space and 42 parking spaces.\nThe project, called Earlington Court Affordable Housing, will be for tenants 55 and older who earn from 30 percent to 80 percent of the area median income, Swezy said. A majority of the apartments will be for those earning 60 percent of AMI.\nMiami-Dade’s annual AMI is $79,400, the Florida Housing Finance Corporation shows. To qualify for a unit designated for tenants at the 60 percent AMI bracket, a one-person household can’t earn more than $47,700, and a two-person household can’t earn more than $54,480.\nCentennial paid $875,000 for the five-lot vacant development site in 2019, records show.\nThe firm is asking the county for an administrative site plan review. It originally filed a request for a pre-application meeting in December.\nSwezy focuses on affordable housing, mainly using the state tax credit program that awards developers tax credits that they sell to investors and use the proceeds to finance projects. Centennial’s portfolio spans more than 3,500 affordable units.\n\nIn recent proposals, Swezy filed an application to Miami-Dade last summer for an\neight-story, 132-unit\nage-restricted building at 13841 Southwest 252nd Street in the Princeton neighborhood.\nTax credits and other state and municipal government financing mechanisms make\naffordable housing\nmore resilient to elevated interest rates. While higher rates and other economic headwinds have\npaused\nsome planned\nmultifamily\nprojects, affordable rental development has continued. Also, demand is nearly ensured as many South Floridians are priced out of market-rate apartments due to\nrecord rent\nhikes in 2021 and 2022.\nAffordable housing also has proved a boon for developers. Last month, Swezy paid\n$14.8 million\nfor a six-bedroom Fisher Island home at 6923 Valencia Drive. He bought it from the widow of the late Russian real estate tycoon Dmitry Zelenov.\nDeveloper Michael Swerdlow wants to redevelop five Miami-Dade public housing complexes with\n5,730\naffordable and workforce apartments. On Tuesday, a county committee approved the project that would replace existing public housing complexes Victory Homes at 520 Northwest 75th Street, Newberg at 7200 Northeast Miami Court, Gwen Cherry 22 at 7101 Northeast Miami Court, Gwen Cherry 06 at the intersection of Northwest 71st Street and Northwest First Court, and New Haven Gardens at 7200 Northeast Second Avenue in Miami.\nThe Pérez family’s Related Group plans an\neight-story, 98-unit\nbuilding at 5350 West Flagler Street in Miami’s Flagami. All units will be for households earning up to 30 percent of AMI.\nAffordable housing developers also have seized on the Live Local Act, a state law that allows bigger projects than permitted by a site’s zoning and also grants property tax breaks to developers.\nRussell Galbut’s GFO Investments family office proposes a\n410-unit Live Local Act project\nwith a 19-story and a 16-story building at 7350 Coral Way in Miami-Dade’s Corral Terrace neighborhood. Dr. Jorge Perez, who specializes in neonatology and neonatal medicine, is a partner on the development and will lease a seven-story medical office building part of the project.\n",

    "content": "Back when the sale of\nSignature Bank’s\nrent-stabilized loan book was fueling industry-wide gossip about\nsweetheart deals\nand stark discounts, the window into the sale process was all-but boarded up.\nNew documents now offer a look into who bid what and which parties’ money couldn’t sway the regulators.\nHere’s the upshot:\nCred over bread\nIn line with industry speculation, two slices of the $14.8 billion rent-stabilized loan book sold on the cheap despite a number of higher bids. That is, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation left some money on the table.\nStakes in the deals were awarded in three separate transactions. The largest went to Santander Bank, which faced no competing bids for the total $9 billion pool, FDIC documents show.\nOn the other sales, a venture led by nonprofit lender\nCommunity Preservation Corporation\nbeat out at least a dozen other parties despite bidding less than competitors.\nFor its 5 percent stake in the larger $4.3 billion pool, it paid the equivalent of 60 cents on the dollar; on the remaining $1.5 billion it paid 56 cents on the dollar, according to FDIC documents.\nConsidering the discounts at which rent-stabilized deals have traded in the past few years, the steep devaluation isn’t surprising.\nRent-regulated revenues have been effectively capped by state law for nearly six years. Meanwhile, expenses, including interest payments on mortgages, have soared. Buildings are underwater, and the deals that do trade are going for\npeanuts\n.\nWhat is striking is that there were four groups willing to pay more for a share of the $4.3 billion pool. The highest: 82 cents on the dollar from a venture between Brookfield Asset Management and Tredway.\nThe $1.5 billion pool drew five bids well above the 56 cents on the dollar CPC paid. The highest: 85 cents on the dollar by an unknown party, according to FDIC documents.\nWho’s worthy\nIn the thick of the sale process, Brookfield and Tredway, perhaps anticipating they’d be passed over, accused the agency of running a\n“secret”\nauction and picking winners that were not the highest bidders.\nThey claimed the move ran afoul of the FDIC’s directive to minimize losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund by maximizing the value of assets.\n\nBut throughout the sale process, the FDIC repeatedly cited its mandate to maximize the preservation of affordable housing. The agency’s pick for the rent-regulated deals — CPC, which partnered with Related Fund Management and nonprofit Neighborhood Restore, seemed to jibe with that directive.\nCPC\ncut its teeth\nrehabilitating rent-stabilized buildings when the Bronx was burning in the 1970s. Neighborhood Restore helps handle the city’s third-party transfer program, which moves abandoned, delinquent buildings to responsible owners. Related, for its part, is a big owner of affordable housing, which it calls a “foundational element” of its company on its site.\nTo be fair, Brookfield and Tredway also own and operate affordable housing. It’s especially Tredway’s niche.\nThough, it could be argued that Brookfield’s rent-stabilized experience is concentrated in new buildings operating under 421a – not the much older stock in the Signature portfolios. And Will Blodgett, formerly of Fairstead, has more than a decade of experience with affordable housing; though, he’d only been running Tredway for two years when the Signature loan sales closed.\nThe FDIC did not specify the other three parties that outbid CPC. But the competition included entities tied to nonprofit Enterprise Community Partners and affordable housing owners and developers CIM Group, Slate Asset Management and Kushner Companies.\nDealing with distress\nThe smaller, $1.5 billion pool drew a different crowd.\nWinhall Investment Company, which deals in non-performing commercial real estate, made what the FDIC considered the next-best bid, though not the highest, at $55 million for a 5 percent equity stake. That’s 32 percent above what the CPC group paid.\nIt’s likely the FDIC, in working to meet its mandate, declined to take more money from a firm that specializes in optimizing the value of distressed debt, not preserving affordable housing.\nOther losing bidders may have raised similar red flags.\nAmong them: Meir Cohen’s Cohen Equities, another distressed debt investor; Ellington Financial, whose parent company foreclosed on the\nApplesway portfolio\nin Houston; and\nInterVest\n, which has partnered with Nightingale of the multi-million-dollar crowdfunding scandal.\nDespite CPC’s problem-solving reputation, the group has had to trade the carrot for the\nstick\nwith some borrowers.\nIn the past few weeks, the JV, operating under the name Community Stabilization Partners, has filed to foreclose on buildings owned by Ved Parkash, once named the city’s worst landlord by the public advocate, and a portfolio Madison Realty Capital acquired from notorious rent-stabilized owner Raphael Toledano. Toledano has since been banned from New York real estate for harassment of rent-stabilized tenants.\nCPC said it is also working out loans; though, it has yet to discuss details of those negotiations.\n",

    "content": "A newspaper printing and distribution plant in Plano has sold for $43.5 million.\nDallasNews Corporation, parent company of the Dallas Morning News, sold the property to Florida-based Denago EV, a low-speed vehicle company that specializes in electric golf carts, the outlet\nreported\n. The sale pencils out to about $70 per square foot.\nDenago plans to use the 29-acre, 620,000-square-foot facility at 3900 West Plano Parkway as a manufacturing hub, joining a growing list of companies establishing production lines in North Texas. DallasNews, formerly known as A.H. Belo Corporation, has owned the property since 1999, county records show.\nIt downsized its printing plant with a five-year lease valued at $3.5 million for a 67,600-square-foot facility in Carrollton last June, according to its\nlatest quarterly report\n. The property’s address was not disclosed.\nProceeds from the sale will be used to fully fund the company’s remaining pension obligations, with plans to transfer the pension to an insurance company. The pension’s balance stood at about $16 million late last year, and the transfer would remove the liability from the company’s balance sheet, it said.\n\nDallasNews’ pension expenses have been rising, with $1.42 million spent on net periodic pension and post-employments benefits in the first nine months of last year, more than double the $674,000 spent during the same period in 2023, the report said.\nThe company said last year it was moving to shed assets and return to profitability by moving to the\nsmaller printing plant with fewer workers\nto save an estimated $5 million a year.\nThe company has been selling off real estate assets since 2019, when it offloaded its historic downtown Dallas office building at 508 Young Street to developer Ray Washburne\nIn February, Washburne said he was selling to “one of the major data companies” to bring a data center to the 546,000-square-foot property,\nthrowing a wrench\nin the city’s intentions to integrate it into its larger convention center redevelopment plan. The deal is slated to close in April, Washburne said.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "The Zappettini family office has defaulted on $120 million in commercial mortgage-backed security loans tied to a 100,000-square-foot tech campus in Mountain View.\nThe San Francisco-based office led by John Zappettini received a notice of default from an undisclosed lender of loans tied to the Terra Bella Tech Park at 850-900 Shoreline Boulevard,  1212-1305 Terra Bella Avenue and 1330-1350 West Middlefield Road,\nthe Silicon Valley Business Journal reported\n.\nThe family bought and developed the 10-acre office and industrial park with 17 buildings in the 1970s, then turned it into a tech campus. In 1921, it tried to redevelop it into a mixed-use village, with homes and commercial properties, according to its website.\nA default notice filed this week gives the Zappettinis 90 days to pay off the default amount. If they fail, the lender will record a notice of sale, Steven Hoffman, a real estate attorney based in Sunnyvale who is not connected to the situation, told the Business Journal.\nThe Business Journal reported in February that the\nMountain View tech campus had been heading toward foreclosure\nor a loan modification after the owner defaulted on a $120 million mortgage debt.\nLoan servicer reports obtained in January showed Zappettini Investment Company failed to repay the mortgage debt by its June 2024 maturity date. The initial loan default was\nfirst reported by The Real Deal\nthat month.\nCiti Real Estate Funding issued the two loans — one for $65 million and a second for $55 million — and then pooled them into commercial mortgage-backed securities deals.\n\nAs of last summer, leases for 40 percent of the tech park’s office, light-industrial and research and development buildings were set to expire within six months, a key factor in the default.\nThe Zappettini family was originally in the wholesale flower importing business and formerly used some of the Mountain View properties for its wholesale operations, according to its website.\nThe Zappettinis sold multiple parcels in Mountain View to Google in 2011, which the tech giant sold a few years later to the Irvine Company, according to public records. They sold another property to Google in 2016 for its now-abandoned\nGoogle Landings\nproject.\nThe family also owned almost 2 acres in the San Francisco Flower Mart from the 1950s until they sold it to Kilroy Realty in 2016 for $31 million in cash and $56 million in stock.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Philadelphia’s real estate industry will be paying close attention to the city’s budget process over the next few months.\nMayor Cherelle Parker revealed her 2025-26 budget proposal on Thursday, Bisnow\nreported\n, spending a few minutes of remarks to talk about real estate. A number of components of her budget proposal directly impact the industry.\nParker proposed the city borrow $800 million over a five-year period to\nbuild and preserve\n30,000 housing units across Philadelphia. The costs could be funded by several tax increases, including upping the real estate transfer tax from 3.28 percent to 3.58 percent, and increasing a document recording fee by $3.\nParker also called for the elimination of a 1 percent construction impact tax in hopes of getting more shovels in the ground. It’s unclear how much of the tax was actually an inhibitor to development, because it only generates $3.5 million for the city per year.\nThe proposal calls for $11 million in additional funding for the Philadelphia Department of Planning and Development to assist the hiring of 32 employees. Parker also pitched a reduction of the city’s wage tax and business income and receipts tax.\n\nNotably omitted from the budget proposal was the\nextension of a 10-year tax abatement\nfor conversion projects, pitched by the Tax Reform Commission last month. Finance Director Rob Dubow said the city prefers to simplify its tax structure by eliminating certain taxes, rather than altering abatements.\nThe city’s next big housing moment is only days away, when Parker reveals her Housing Opportunities Made Easy Initiative at a special session, a hearing she’s herself described as a “D-Day for housing.” That hearing is scheduled for March 24.\nThe coming fiscal year, meanwhile, begins on July 1, so the City Council needs to negotiate and adopt a budget before then.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "Fair Housing Act funding for Chicago-area organizations is frozen.\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development abruptly terminated or delayed grants to at least five local groups as well as 78 grantees across the country, leaving some without contracts or reimbursement since the start of the year, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nAmong those impacted is the Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, which had 16 months left in a three-year grant totaling $425,000 annually.\nThe termination was directed by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, according to HUD’s termination letter to the group, which said the grant “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”\nAt least one group is challenging the cancellations in court, saying the termination of funds awarded through HUD’s Fair Housing Initiatives Program is illegal.\nFour members of the National Fair Housing Alliance are suing HUD and DOGE over the allegedly unlawful cancellation of more than $30 million in grants through the program. The lawsuit, which is seeking class-action status, was filed Thursday in federal court in Massachusetts.\nThe South Suburban Housing Center and Open Communities in Evanston received the same letter and faces similar funding losses posed to disrupt decades of work supporting low-income and minority communities.\nThe nonprofit lost its two grants, which totaled about $1.4 million over the next three years, funds it has received since 1995. The amount represented 92 percent of its fair housing budget and 37 percent of its total organizational budget.\n\nChicago’s Continuum of Care network — responsible for coordinating housing services for the homeless — has over $112 million in HUD grants still pending contracts. At least 14 organizations have been operating without reimbursement since January.\nThe cuts come amid broader federal workforce reductions at HUD, including layoffs at the agency’s Chicago office.\nHUD Secretary Scott Turner, who was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on Feb. 5, has defended the changes, saying the agency is “taking inventory” to improve efficiency. HUD officials have promised some clarity in the coming weeks, with letters to awardees expected soon.\nThe cuts are targeting racial justice initiatives and could erode protections for vulnerable groups, particularly as\nhousing discrimination\ncomplaints rise and\naffordable housing options shrink\n, the National Fair Housing Alliance said.\nFor other organizations, like Ignite, which provides services for homeless youth as the parent organization for Continuum of Care, the clock is ticking.\nIgnite has dipped into reserves to continue operations while awaiting its yearly $320,000 contract reimbursement. Others are turning to donors or state-level funding to close the gaps.\n— Judah Duke\n",

The plan also included indoor and outdoor parking and a public park.\nDes Plaines city officials had postponed a scheduled February review to give Advent time to revise the project following feedback from the council in December. But Advent withdrew its application earlier this month without explanation, according to city planning memos.\nAdvent, an entity tied to Paul Dukach, is reportedly still evaluating future development options for the nearly 3-acre site.\n\nThe withdrawal halts momentum for a proposal that could have contributed to Des Plaines’ broader downtown revitalization efforts. The suburb has been actively courting multifamily and mixed-use developments to reshape its urban core. Nearby projects include\nCompasspoint Development’s 131-unit apartment complex\nand the 212-unit Welkin project that opened in 2022.\nThe downtown Des Plaines apartment market has been\na draw for developers\nin recent years, with suburban multifamily investment outperforming Chicago’s core in terms of rental growth.\nSuburban rents rose 4 percent year over year in the fourth quarter, compared to 2.3 percent for central Chicago, according to Integra Realty Resources.\nAdvent’s withdrawal leaves a gap in the city’s downtown growth plans, though local officials indicated that development conversations could continue in the future.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "A Seattle-based lender has filed a lawsuit against real estate investor Gary Segal, seeking more than $67.1 million for allegedly failing to honor a personal guarantee on a defaulted commercial real estate loan.\nColumbia Pacific Advisors filed the\ncomplaint\nthis week in New York Supreme Court, PincusCo\nreported\n. The lender claims Segal breached his obligations under a personal guaranty agreement tied to a loan for a Long Island City industrial warehouse, where an office development is planned.\nSegal guaranteed a loan made in December 2021 to the entity that owns 23-10 Queens Plaza South, according to the complaint. The original loan amount was $38.5 million, but through several modifications, the principal allegedly increased to $56.9 million by March 2024.\nThe lawsuit claims Segal failed to repay the loan when it matured in August. Despite receiving a notice of default in October, neither the borrower entity nor Segal has made any payments toward the outstanding debt, which now exceeds $67.1 million including interest and fees, according to the complaint.\nColumbia Pacific Advisors is seeking a judgment for the full amount due, plus ongoing default interest, legal fees and other costs outlined in the loan documents.\nThe lender initiated a separate UCC foreclosure process on the ownership interests in the borrowing entity. An auction is scheduled for May 9.\n\nColumbia Pacific Advisors did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n. Segal could not be reached for comment.\nTwo years ago, the City Council passed a zoning change that would allow Segal’s firm, Dynamic Star, to develop a 400,000-square-foot office building at the site, dubbed Opus Point. Segal purchased the property in 2019\nfor $27.5 million\n.\nLong Island City is not the only place where Dynamic Star is putting out alleged financial fires. This year, a joint venture of Blackstone and Rialto Capital\nfiled a pre-foreclosure action\n, alleging Dynamic Star and Namdar Realty Group defaulted on a loan for the Fordham Landing site in the Bronx.\nThe lender is seeking a receiver to oversee the site while pursuing a forced sale.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "Fort Worth will trade vintage charm for modern development, rezoning the Montgomery Street Antique Mall site to clear the way for a 12-story hotel and mixed-use project.\nFort Worth City Council greenlighted development of the 7.4-acre site at 2501 and 2601 Montgomery Street, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nDallas developer Phoenix Property Company and landowner Montgomery Corner LLC, an entity tied to American Land and Cattle and Luther King Capital Management, plan to replace the long-standing antique mall with a hotel, ground-floor retail and a separate multifamily building.\nThe plans also leave room for a brewery or distillery, though Phoenix told the city’s zoning commission last month that such uses aren’t currently in the works. The development is near Fort Worth’s Cultural District, just off Interstate 30.\nThe antique mall has been a fixture in the district for more than 30 years, drawing loyal patrons and housing the Secret Garden restaurant. News of the redevelopment sparked social media backlash, with some residents calling it a “terrible decision” that could displace locals and worsen traffic. No one spoke in opposition at the council’s zoning hearing, despite online pushback.\nCouncil member Macy Hill noted that developers met with local stakeholders prior to the meeting and expressed optimism about the project’s potential to modernize the area.\n\nMontgomery Street Antique Mall’s owners have yet to announce whether the business will relocate or close.\nPhoenix is also working with the Texas Department of Transportation to address concerns about traffic flow and access at the nearby intersection of Montgomery Street and I-30.\nThe project is part of the redevelopment trend across Fort Worth. The council rezoned more than 83 acres along Montgomery Street for intensive commercial use, and downtown plans are progressing, including more than $2 billion in future projects and reimagining\nPanther Island as a waterfront district\n.\n— Judah Duke\nREAD MORE LINKS:\n",

    "content": "San Francisco officials have delayed suspending a voter-approved “Empty Homes Tax” during a legal challenge because of a push by Supervisor Jackie Fielder to keep the measure alive.\nThe tax, known as Proposition M, was approved in November 2022 with 54 percent of the vote and targets property owners with residential units left vacant for over 182 days a year,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nTaxes range from $2,500 to $5,000 based on size, rising to a maximum of $20,000 a year per unit, applying only to buildings with three or more apartments.\nFielder argued that amendments should be explored to prevent the tax from being suspended indefinitely while the city fights a lawsuit from landlords and property owners who say it violates their property rights.\nShe proposed that the tax suspension should only last “until the courts tell us otherwise,” allowing the city to collect if legally permitted. Fielder’s motion to continue the vote passed unanimously, with a hearing set for March 18.\nThe Empty Homes Tax took effect at the beginning of last year, with collections planned for upcoming April.\n\nProponents estimated it would generate more than $20 million a year for housing and unlock about 5,000 units within two years, though critics have questioned the projections.\nThe tax has faced legal challenges since February 2023, when property owner groups filed a lawsuit alleging it was coercive and infringed on their rights.\nIn December 2023, Superior Court Judge Charles Haines\ndeclined to dismiss the lawsuit\narguing in a ruling that property owners don’t need to wait until the tax is due to challenge it in court. In October, Haines\nstruck down the tax\n, saying that it violated the U.S. and California constitutions and was preempted by California law.\nThe court subsequently ordered the city to halt enforcement and collection, and the city treasurer stated that property owners would not be required to pay by the original April 30, 2025 deadline unless the court’s decision is reversed on appeal.\nThe city attorney’s office is now appealing the ruling and has expressed disappointment with the trial court’s decision.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "The flight to quality office trend is responsible for yet another corporate relocation.\nAnderson Merchandisers is moving its headquarters from one Plano office to another; it’s leaving Granite Properties’ Granite Park III, which was built in 2007, for Apex at Legacy, a property delivered in 2021.\nThe retail merchandising company inked a deal to occupy 30,000 square feet — the full top floor — at the 210,000-square-foot office building, according to a news release from JLL. Anderson is bringing more than 100 employees to the space by the fourth quarter of this year, with plans to hire more.\nJLL’s Conor McCarthy and Jayme Schutt represented the tenant in lease negotiations. John Brownlee, Gini Rounsaville and Michael Williams represented the landlord, Monarch Alternative Capital and Tourmaline Capital Partners.\nApex at Legacy, at 5801 Headquarters Drive, is a 14-story office building that was\ndeveloped\nby Dallas-based Heady Investments. Monarch Alternative Capital and Tourmaline Capital Partners purchased the property in 2021.\n\nIt includes features like a game lounge that includes a golf simulator. It’s within walking distance from Legacy West, a mixed-use development in Plano with more than 400,000 square feet of retail and office space.\nThere are plans for expansion — the development will soon feature a second building with office space and a Kimpton Hotel, the release said.\nCorporate America’s push to return to the office has emphasized the flight-to-quality trend in the office market.\nCompanies like Anderson Merchandisers are luring employees into the office with top-of-the-line amenities. Meanwhile, operators of older inventory are under pressure to compete with new deliveries.\nThat’s just one segment of the Dallas-Fort Worth office market, which had 52.8 million square feet of unused office space in November. The Metroplex ranked third in the country for office vacancy, behind New York and Chicago.\n",

    "content": "Richard Ohebshalom’s Downtown\nBrooklyn rental building\nwent back to the lender in a foreclosure auction.\nChicago-based commercial real estate lender Prime Finance bought the brick-clad 103-unit apartment building at 180 Nassau Street for $1,000. There were no other bidders at the auction — but a few gasps erupted from the gallery as the $51.5 million upset price was announced.\nThe lender filed a foreclosure suit in 2022, the same year it bought a $52 million note on the property from Investors Bank. Prime claimed that Pink Stone failed to resume debt payments after a forbearance period extended to the developer ended that year. The court appointed a receiver in May 2023.\nThe debt on the property had ballooned to $58 million by August, when a state Supreme Court judge ordered a foreclosure auction for the property.\n\nOhebshalom, the son of Empire Management’s Fred Ohebshalom, bought the development site at Nassau and Duffield streets for $11.28 million from Brooklyn developer Isaac Hager in 2012. He wrapped up construction in 2014 on the 10-story rental building, known as Warehouse 180, and Investors issued the $52 million loan that year.\nOhebshalom tried\nselling the property\nin 2018, asking north of $60 million according to sources at the time, but no deal was reached. A potential obstacle was the looming phase-out of the building’s 421a property tax abatement, which caused property taxes owed on the building to increase.\nIn 2023, Ohebshalom\nlost control\nof a 7-story Soho building, including an apartment where he lived, after pledging the property as collateral for $4 million in mezzanine loans. A few years earlier, in 2018, Pink Stone found itself embroiled in a family feud when Ohebshalom filed\ntwo lawsuits\nagainst his father.\n",

    "content": "Longtime Douglas Elliman agent Pablo Alfaro joined Compass.\nAlfaro left\nElliman\nafter about 14 years. He’s been involved in sales totaling more than $1 billion over his 20-year career, according to a press release. That includes helping to bring new developments to Elliman such as Faena House, Alan Faena and Len Blavatnik’s ultra-luxury condo building; and Ian Schrager’s Edition Residences. Both are in Miami Beach.\nAlfaro most recently was\nleading sales\nat Rivage Bal Harbour Residences, Related Group, Two Roads Development and Rockpoint’s oceanfront luxury condo building at 10245 Collins Avenue. His listings include the nearly $25 million listing of a penthouse at Palazzo del Mare on Fisher Island. Recent deals include supermodel Elle Macpherson’s\n$18.5 million sale\nof her Coral Gables mansion in September.\nAlfaro joined\nCompass\non Monday, state records show. He’ll be based out of the Lincoln Road office in Miami Beach.\n\n“I see a lot of major changes going on in the industry, upper management, the way we run our business, social media. Compass was the best partner for me,” Alfaro said. “I run my business in a very private way.”\nAlfaro is the latest agent to leave Elliman for Compass over the past year. In South Florida, that list includes Thor Brown in Palm Beach and Bonnie Heatzig in Boca Raton. More recently, New York broker\nHolly Parker\n, who also operates in South Florida, joined Compass after 24 years with Elliman.\nThe moves have gone in both directions. While Elliman’s senior vice president of sales for development marketing in Miami,\nNikol Solares\n, left the brokerage for Compass in January,\nElliman brought on Drew Backoff\nas vice president of marketing for new development. Backoff was previously a senior leader at Compass’ development marketing arm.\n",

    "content": "Just south of Palm Beach, the small island town known for its popularity with the rich and powerful, lies an even smaller island town: Manalapan. Long overshadowed by its more famous neighbor, it is now an ultra-luxury market hub with some of Florida’s most expensive home listings.\n“In the past, everyone only wanted to be on the [Palm Beach] island. Now, we’re seeing specifically people who want to be in Manalapan,” said Douglas Elliman agent Senada Adžem. “It’s not a Palm Beach address, but it’s become very prominent.”\nCurrently six properties are listed in Manalapan asking more than $50 million, remarkable for a town that spans just 2.4 square miles and has about 400 year-round residents, agents say. Those\ntrophy listings\ninclude a 4-acre spec estate\nasking $285 million\n. It would be the priciest home on the market in the U.S., except for a 9-acre Naples compound\nlisted for $295 million\n.\n“I’m shocked. I’m a little blown away with the amount of interest we’ve received,” said Nick Malinosky, the Douglas Elliman agent representing the record Manalapan listing.\nPerhaps the first sign of Manalapan’s ultra-luxury boom was\nbillionaire Larry Ellison’s $173 million\npurchase of a 16-acre oceanfront compound in 2022. It remains the most expensive home ever sold in Florida. Ellison doubled down on his investment in the town in August, dropping $277.4 million on the\nEau Palm Beach Resort &amp; Spa\n. All Manalapan residents are granted free membership to the resort, which functions as the de facto town center.\nOther high-profile Manalapan buyers include Fox News host Sean Hannity, who bought a waterfront mansion for\n$23.5 million\nin November.\nStill, brokers say many of their clients are interested first in a Palm Beach home. The island emerged from the pandemic as\nan epicenter of the American ultra-luxury market\n, a place where homes frequently trade for north of $50 million. Last year, the two\nmost expensive home sales in Florida\nwere both in Palm Beach: A private island sold for\n$150 million\n, and a historic oceanfront estate traded for\n$148 million\n. But with fewer than 2,500 homes on the 16-mile long barrier island, Palm Beach options are limited.\nPalm Beach’s market also has a crucial mismatch between what buyers want to buy and what sellers want to sell. Since the onset of the pandemic, affluent buyers across South Florida have prioritized large, oceanfront properties in turnkey condition. Nothing on the market in Palm Beach fits that bill. Pocket listings for such homes have make-me-move prices that agents say range from about $100 million to as much as $300 million.\nMeanwhile, oceanfront properties in Manalapan are abundant, and buyers don’t have to pay the premium for a Palm Beach address.\n“You’re going to get more bang for your buck,” Malinosky said.\nIn addition to large lots –– oceanfront Manalapan estates have a minimum of 150 feet of beach frontage –– the enclave is also a short distance from private schools, private airports and private clubs like President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago. Many of the properties have both oceanfront and Intracoastal Waterway frontage, allowing for residents to keep their yachts docked in the backyard.\n\n“What they have to offer is exceptional,” said Corcoran Group agent Candace Friis, who has an oceanfront Manalapan listing asking $87 million.\nMalinosky agreed, saying spec developers in Manalapan also have a keen understanding of what ultra-luxury buyers want, something\nothers have struggled with\n.\n“There is no shortage of buyers who can spend $100 million, $200 million right now,” he said. But they want homes that check all the boxes: spa facilities, office space, a guest house and staff quarters are must-haves for buyers at that price range. Manalapan has ample listings with these amenities, agents said.\nAll together, these market dynamics have made Manalapan a household name among a certain set of sophisticated buyers, agents added.\n“There was a time I would have to explain to buyers coming to town what Manalapan is,” said Malinosky. Not anymore.\nHere are this season’s trophy listings in Manalapan:\n$285M | 1960 South Ocean Boulevard | Seller: Stewart Satter\nSpec developer and former Manalapan mayor Stewart Satter is\nasking $285 million\nfor the 4-acre ocean-to-Intracoastal estate planned for 1960 South Ocean Boulevard. He bought the land for $27.5 million in March, records show. The planned estate will have a 50,390-square-foot main house with eight bedrooms, nine bathrooms, seven half-bathrooms and two kitchens. It will also have a guest house, boathouse, beach house, car museum, bowling alley, shooting range, padel court, gym, spa, theater and golf simulator, the listing shows. The design team for the estate, which is\nbeing marketed fully furnished\n, includes architecture firm Choeff Levy Fishman and Marc-Michaels Interior Design.\nMalinosky has the listing.\n$150M | 1370 South Ocean Boulevard | Seller: Christopher Rokos\nBillionaire hedge funder Christopher Rokos is asking $150 million for his 2.8-acre ocean-to-Intracoastal estate. The founder of London-based Rokos Capital Management has a net worth of $2.3 billion, according to Forbes. He bought the estate for $40 million in 2017, records show. The 18,400-square-foot mansion was built in 1972 and renovated in 2015. It has nine bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, five half-bathrooms, a spa wing with a gym and wellness facilities, a billiard room, game room, theater and a 10-car garage with a club room, according to records and the listing. It is being marketed fully furnished with interiors by Marc-Michaels Interior Design.\nJack Elkins with William Raveis has the listing.\n$95M | 1140 South Ocean Boulevard | Seller: Joe Farrell\nSpec developer Joe Farrell has already found a buyer for the oceanfront estate at 1140 South Ocean Boulevard. He listed it for $95 million in August, and it became pending earlier this month, Redfin shows. Farrell bought the 1.6-acre site for\n$32.5 million\nin January of last year, and is planning a 19,000-square-foot, nine-bedroom main house and a 4,000-square-foot, four-bedroom guest house, eight-car garage, two pools and a pickleball court, the listing shows. Construction is expected to be completed later this year.\nMargit Brandt with Premier Estate Properties is representing both parties in the deal, she confirmed.\n$87M | 1160 South Ocean Boulevard | Seller: Robert Wexler\nSpec developer Robert Wexler is asking $87 million for the renovated oceanfront estate at 1160 South Ocean Boulevard. Records show his NBU Land Trust bought the 1.7-acre compound from Cantor Companies CEO Michael Cantor for\n$28 million\nin 2021. The estate was built in 1995 and renovated in 2022, records show. The compound includes a 14,800-square-foot main house with seven bedrooms, 10 bathrooms and two half-bathrooms, according to records. It also has a 1,700-square-foot, two-bedroom guest house, a pool, gym, wine room, game room, theater, 13-car garage, staff quarters and a catering kitchen, the listing shows.\nCandace Friis and Phillip Friis with the Corcoran Group have the listing.\n$85M | 640 South Ocean Boulevard | Seller: Robert Wexler\nWexler has another listing down the road at 640 South Ocean Boulevard asking $85 million. Records show his trust bought the 1.9-acre oceanfront estate for\n$36 million\nin 2020. Built in 2019, it includes a 12,800-square-foot main house with nine bedrooms, 12 bathrooms and six half-bathrooms, according to property records. The compound also has a guest house, a guard house at the entrance, a wine room, gym, spa and pool, the listing shows.\nCasey Flannery with Equestrian Sotheby’s International Realty has the listing.\n$79M | 1040 South Ocean Boulevard | Seller: 1040 Ocean LLC\nA Delaware entity named for the address is selling the estate at 1040 South Ocean Boulevard, asking $79 million for the 2.2-acre compound built in 2018. The LLC’s address is listed as 616 Nimes Road in Los Angeles, which is a Bel Air mansion currently on the market for $56.8 million. The listing agent told the Wall Street Journal the owners are European, but declined to comment further on their identities. They bought the Manalapan mansion for\n$25.8 million\nin 2021.\nThe estate has a 16,400-square-foot mansion with eight bedrooms, 12 bathrooms, three half-bathrooms, a guest house and a pool, according to records and the listing.\nMargit Brandt has the listing.\n$69.9M | 1460 South Ocean Boulevard | Seller: Vivian Dimond\nDeveloper and investor Vivian Dimond is asking $69.9 million for the 1.5-acre oceanfront estate at 1460 South Ocean Boulevard.

In the firm’s most recent earnings call, Reffkin said 7,500, or 35 percent of the company’s listings, were off-MLS. In February, more than half of new Compass listings started as private exclusives or were available only on Compass.com, which are part of the company’s latest\nconsumer marketing strategy\n.",

    "content": "Padel may have fans everywhere\nfrom Brooklyn\nto\nBillionaires’ Row\n, but West Village residents won’t allow a new private members’ club hinged on the sport to get a liquor license without a fight.\nRoughly 30 people living in the neighborhood rallied against the proposal for 120 Leroy Street, which includes a rooftop restaurant and three padel courts, at a meeting with the state’s liquor licensing authority on Thursday.\nAmong their concerns, residents, brandishing signs reading “No Rooftop Restaurant” and “No Private Padel,” claim the project would drive noise up and add traffic and congestion to the largely residential area.\n“The community has been asking for a year, ‘Let us see your plans,’” said Massimo D’Angelo, an attorney representing a group of residents, who argued the team behind the project — including clothing designer Ronnie Fieg, the Cayre family’s Midtown Equities and the owners of Cafe Mogador — has been reluctant to share information with residents concerned about the plans.\nD’Angelo added that 450 local residents signed a petition opposing the project.\nThe authority denied a temporary permit for the premises and ordered the team behind the project to amend the application. Chair Lily Fan rebuked the applicants for failing to negotiate a solution.\n“Do something reasonable so that people will welcome you,” Fan said. She added that without the neighborhood’s support, “I don’t see how your business is going to survive.”\n“Convincing me is not a win,” Fan added. “That’s just the beginning. It’s these 450 people you have to convince”\nThe clash at the meeting was the latest development in a contentious saga between neighborhood residents and spearheads of the project, which is described as a private members’ club with spa, wellness, padel facilities and a restaurant. The restaurant is open to members of the public with a $50 cover charge.\nPlans for the building initially included a rooftop bar, though an attorney for the owners, Donald Bernstein, said zoning wouldn’t allow it. The developers instead pivoted to a rooftop extension of the restaurant and agreed not to allow any background music.\nAt the hearing, Bernstein said his clients would amend their application to exclude the restaurant’s rooftop extension and would seek only to license the restaurant on the floor below.\nAn architect for the project said at the hearing that the developers had invested $7 million in the project so far and that construction was about halfway finished with an expected completion in September or October this year — though residents strongly objected to his characterization of the progress.\n“That’s bullshit,” one resident yelled from the back of the room.\nAnother said, “We have eyes, you know.”\nWhen members of the authority asked attendees to quiet down, another added, “Someone needs to point out that he’s lying.”\nBut Bernstein dismissed their comments.\n“Money has been spent. Construction is being done,” he said.\nBernstein urged the authority to disregard the community’s objections to noise from the padel court, as the liquor license, if granted, would only apply to the restaurant and its rooftop extension, before he agreed to scrap it.\n“Whatever issue and complaints they have about the padel courts, this is not the right [venue] for it,” Bernstein said.\n\nFieg, Michael Cayre and a representative for the Mogador owners did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe throwdown over the proposal began heating up last spring, when the developers applied for a liquor license and outlined their plans for the property’s roof and ninth floor. The fight was first reported by the\nNew York Post\n,\nIn the application, the team laid out its vision: a private members club with a spa, restaurant run by the acclaimed East Village restaurateurs, padel courts and a rooftop lounge with background music and the occasional DJ. The club, open from 7 a.m. until midnight, would allow non-members for a $50 fee and up to 20 private parties a year.\nResidents quickly rose up to block the plans. In May, members of Community Board 2, which includes Greenwich Village and the West Village, voted 33 to 1 to oppose the project, urging the SLA to deny the license application.\n“Noise pollution from this type of venue would be detrimental,” a couple with an eight-month-old child living at 421 Hudson Street wrote in a letter opposing the license. “A rooftop venue\nwith padel courts, alcohol, and loud music/live DJ all day until 12 a.m. every night of the\nweek is not at all in line with the character of this area.”\nAnother resident of the condo building objected to the project, claiming it would add “noise, drunken rowdiness, and crime to our lovely area.”\nBut the board’s vote was a suggestion, not a mandate, and the developer’s application continued to move forward, with residents pushing back each step of the way.\nThe following month, two state legislators, whose districts include neighborhoods near 120 Leroy, also wrote a letter to the SLA, encouraging them to deny the property’s liquor license. In the letter, State Senator Brian Kavanaugh and Assemblymember Deborah Glick pointed to residential buildings surrounding the property.\n“Most problematic is the rooftop bar and lounge,” Kavanaugh and Glick wrote in the letter, arguing it “would significantly increase the noise level experienced by these residents on a daily basis and late into the evening.”\nDespite residents’ vehement protests, by the end of the summer, signs pointed toward the license’s approval.\nSince the project is near other establishments that sell alcohol, it’s subject to the 500 Foot Law, which means the authority must determine whether issuing the license would be in the “public interest.”\nIn August, a judge sided with the applicants in a report, ruling the proposal met the public interest burden and recommending the authority grant the license.\nAt a January hearing on the license, community members once again voiced their objections to the project, and SLA chair Lily Fan ordered the developers to confer with residents privately to come to a resolution.\nBut a February meeting between the parties was to no avail.\n“The Applicants appeared for the February 22, 2025, Meet and Confer wholly unprepared and unwilling to foster a meaningful conversation with respect to the community members’ well documented and previously expressed concerns,” Massimo D’Angelo, an attorney representing a group of residents wrote to Fan last week.\nNow it’s back to the drawing board for the project’s team, who will have to re-file their application for a liquor license without the rooftop portion. Even with a small win under their belt, residents don’t appear to be backing down from their position.\n“Even if this proposed open-air padel stadium could be covered with a bubble, it would not be able to reduce the noise and lights that would disrupt this West Village residential community,” D’Angelo wrote in a statement.\n",

    "content": "A venture involving Zell Kravinsky’s Morning Sky Capital scooped up a 63-unit apartment complex on the bank of the Fox River in the northwest suburbs of Chicago from multifamily giant Greg Fowler’s firm, which previously bought it out of distress.\nKravinsky’s company partnered with several other investors to pay $19.3 million for the ReNew on Main property at 1 North Main Street in Algonquin, public records show. The price of $302,000 per unit included assuming an existing mortgage with a balance of more than $11 million that the San Francisco-based seller, FPA Multifamily, previously took out on the property, sparing the buyer from shopping for debt at today’s elevated interest rates.\nFor FPA, one of Chicagoland’s largest multifamily landlords, the deal extends a streak of activity in the area that has tended to follow the same pattern: the firm is\nselling off its smaller assets\nand buying up bigger ones with funds the transactions generate. The Algonquin deal closed right as\nFPA bought a 356-unit Naperville apartment complex\nfor $68 million, in another deal where it assumed the existing debt of the seller, Chicago-based Rockwell Partners.\n“There is not a lot of liquidity in the market right now, which is good for people who have a conviction in the market and are ready to make a bet,” said Morning Sky’s Lev Kravinsky. “In general most of what we’re buying nowadays is either all cash or loan assumption. It’s difficult but not impossible to find deals that pencil with fresh debt.”\nFPA didn’t return a request for comment on the Algonquin transaction.\nWhile the deal is relatively small for FPA, the seller posted a gain on the property after buying it out of distress in 2018 for $12.7 million ($201,600 per unit). The complex, which also includes six ground-floor retail units, has a checkered ownership history after running into delays during its development, and financial trouble after its 2011 completion.\n\nFPA bought it from a financial institution, Boston-based UC Funds, which acquired the property through foreclosure. The property was conceived as a 54-unit luxury condo project, awarded to Aspen Homebuilders back in 2006 by the village of Algonquin. Aspen went bankrupt two years later, and the firm’s owner, Bruce Hawkins, pleaded guilty in 2013 to defrauding a bank of more than $1 million, the Northwest Herald previously\nreported\n.\nThe building remained unfinished for years, until developer John Bruegelmans took over the project in 2011 and gained approval to convert the project into rentals. Residents started moving in during 2015, but Buregelmans filed for bankruptcy in 2016 to restructure construction debt, the newspaper reported.\nThat’s what prompted a UC Funds entity to take over the building and eventually sell it to FPA.\nMeanwhile, buyers in Chicago and its suburban multifamily markets are\nset to raise rents\nin the coming year as new supply craters amid a development dropoff.\nMorning Sky owns several other apartment complexes in the area, with three in the suburbs and one in the city, Lev Kravinsky said. His father, Morning Sky principal Zell Kravinsky, is well-known as a philanthropist and longtime real estate investor.\n",

    "content": "Andrew Cuomo got some attention this week for\ndefending bail reform\n, a\nmeasure\nhe signed as governor that critics blamed for rising crime (a claim the data\ndid not actually prove\n) and for signaling that wrongdoers wouldn’t be held accountable.\nBut there was another Cuomo action that sticks in the craw of some real estate people even more: his attempt to\nrein in the title industry\n.\nOne person from that field told me that although he’s not impressed with the other mayoral candidates, he won’t be voting for Cuomo because of the battle over\nRegulation 208\n.\nCuomo’s Department of Financial Services didn’t think customers should bear any of the cost of title insurance agents’ entertainment of real estate professionals — that is, the folks who can steer homebuyers’ business to them.\nIn fact, DFS tried to forbid the industry from giving gifts or doing anything resembling “wining and dining.” The agency called out such “unscrupulous practices” as bad for consumers, who tend not to shop around for title insurance.\nThe regulations followed a DFS investigation that the agency said “revealed that title insurance companies and agents have spent millions of dollars on inducements that the industry has charged back to consumers as ‘marketing costs.’”\nBut the industry challenged Cuomo’s action in court. The legal battle went on for years but title insurers eventually won — overcoming a\nruling in Cuomo’s favor\nby the Appellate Division, which called the inducements an “ethically dubious scheme.” Regulation 208 remains on the books today.\n“Why is it illegal for me to market my services!” the title professional said by email. “Why are we, as an industry, the only people in the real estate sector that are not allowed to entertain our clients? Must we go Dutch when inviting a client or prospective client for lunch or dinner?”\nWhat we’re thinking about:\nOne landlord on X bemoaned the field of mayoral contenders,\ncommenting\n, “Who would we vote for other than Cuomo? Eric Adams is Trump’s bitch; all the other candidates seem to be looney tunes\nDSA types\n.” Do you agree? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we’ve learned\n: Of all the metro areas in the country, New York had the largest natural growth last year, with 214,000 births and 141,000 deaths.\nElsewhere…\nNormally, New York City apartments priced below market rate don’t stay vacant long. But an owner of a 10-building portfolio in the Bronx lost $117,000 in potential rent last year while trying to re-rent affordable units through the city’s Housing Connect lottery system, according to a New York Housing Conference\nreport\n.\n\nThe group’s analysis focused on why it takes so long to match these units with eligible tenants, which should be like selling ice cream cones for a dollar on a 100-degree day.\nIn the above example, the landlord estimated that it would have missed only $20,000 in rent had it been able to simply list the units. The portfolio’s vacancy rate would have been 0.6 percent instead of 3 percent.\nIn case you missed it, check out\nmy column\nabout the poorly designed system that produces this result for owners of affordable housing across the city.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Thursday was\n$10.35 million\nfor a 2,695-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 500 West 18th Street in Chelsea. Deborah Kern and Steve Gold of the Corcoran Group had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$259.5 million\nfor a portion of 333 Schermerhorn Street in Downtown Brooklyn. Steiner NYC purchased the remaining stake from JPMorgan, Crain’s\nreported\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$12 million\nfor a 3,344-square-foot townhouse at 214 West 11th Street in the West Village. The Eklund Gomes Team at Douglas Elliman has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 93,072-square-foot, 12-story community and housing facility at 1546 East New York Avenue in Brownsville. David Kriegel filed the permit on behalf of Xenolith Partners.\n— Matthew Elo",

Aghamiri’s Msasa Properties\nfiled plans in September 2023\nto build the seven-story complex near San Jose’s Japantown.\nWith developers having built no market-rate projects larger than 20 units in the city last year, Aghamiri’s project appears to be the first large-scale multifamily development since 2023, in which 336 units were built.\nPlans call for 118 apartments on a half-acre north of Basset Street between North First and North Second streets, with six set aside as affordable for very low-income households. Parking would be available for 74 cars.\nInitial plans by Aghamiri included 18 affordable units, or 15 percent, but he cut it to 5 percent to make the project pencil out, according to Erik Schoennauer, a local land use consultant who spoke on behalf of the developer.\n\nThe project, designed by Oakland-based Studio T-Square, features a charcoal and white complex with balconies, according to a rendering, bookended by a brown brick sections.\nThe site is located in an opportunity zone, which offers tax advantages to developers.\nAghamiri bought the office property in 2022 for $5.3 million, or $442 per square foot.\nThe 61-year-old offices have been vacant for 10 months, and have been damaged by vandals, Schoennauer said. They’ve been 60 percent vacant for more than five years\nHe said Aghamiri hopes to break ground this summer, and complete the project in 20 to 24 months.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Add to the shuffle Chinese furniture manufacturer Sunon, which is negotiating to sublease R1 RCM’s 13,000 square feet space at 800 West Fulton.\nIf finalized, Sunon would join other furniture brands in the area, using the space as a showroom.\nR1 RCM was represented by JLL’s Andy Strand, Vital Proteins by Colliers’ Dougal Jeppe, and Sunon by JLL’s Sarah Silva and Nicole Becker.\nSterling Bay’s new offices will span the top two floors of a three-story building owned by Asana Partners.\n\nSterling Bay began to\nshed its Chicago assets\nlast year, likely to finance its Lincoln Yards project, a multi-billion-dollar mixed-use development on Chicago’s North Side\nthat has failed to attract investment\n.\nThe firm has also\nbeen selling off\nsome development parcels near Lincoln Yards and within Fulton Market itself.\nSterling Bay developed the 553,000-square-foot building at 333 North Green Street with JPMorgan in 2019, signing a long-term lease to have its offices in the building as part of the deal. The 19-story building is fully leased after nearly 97,000 square feet was\nleased by Dutch financial technology firm Adyen\nlate last year.\nFulton Market gained Google’s Midwest headquarters as well as McDonald’s, which leased the office building where Oprah Winfrey’s Harpo Studios once stood.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "A financier’s West Village condo just set a new record for Downtown Manhattan.\nHarsh Padia, CEO of HAP Capital, and his wife, interior designer Purvi Padia, traded their apartment for $60 million in an off-market deal that closed Thursday, the\nWall Street Journal\nfirst reported. The sale price was double what the Padias paid for the apartment in 2016.\nThe deal is now the most expensive for a condo in the area, surpassing private equity billionaire Robert Smith’s\n$59 million\npurchase of a penthouse in the Getty Building in 2018.\nThough it’s the priciest for a condo on record, the deal fell short of the largest townhouse sales Downtown, including a\n$73 million\nmegamansion that closed in Greenwich Village last year.\nThe buyer, whose identity remains unknown, paid roughly $10,300 per square foot for the duplex, which also features a sprawling private terrace overlooking the Hudson River. The ninth-floor unit has five bedrooms, five bathrooms and a spiral staircase.\nSerhant’s Peter Zaitzeff and Compass’ Jim St. André represented the Padias in the deal. Compass’ Eric Brown and Zeve Salman brought the buyer.\n\nThe Witkoff Group’s 150 Charles has snagged several pricey resales in recent years. A company tied to Credit Suisse executive Robert Shafir sold a penthouse at the building for\n$52 million\n, or a whopping $11,500 per square foot, in 2023 after purchasing it for $29 million in 2016.\nThe developer launched sales at the building in 2013 and racked up an A-list roster of buyers, including Ben Stiller, Jon Bon Jovi and Irina Shayk. The building’s amenities include a spa, pool and fitness center.\nAlex Witkoff is now the sole CEO of Witkoff Group after his father, Steve Witkoff, was appointed special envoy to the Middle East by President Donald Trump. The elder Witkoff told Bloomberg this week he was in the\nprocess of divesting\nfrom his development firm and a cryptocurrency firm he co-founded with Alex and his other son, Zach Witkoff, to avoid conflicts of interest.\n—\nSheridan Wall\n",

    "content": "Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi is pushing the federal government to release property appraisal data to the country’s largest assessors to help improve the accuracy of property tax assessments, which have received criticism locally for being systemically flawed.\nA resolution sponsored by Kaegi calls for the Federal Housing Finance Agency to hand data containing “millions of property appraisals” over to 16 of the nation’s largest assessment offices, according to a news release.\nThe assessor made the request just a day before the Senate on Thursday confirmed President Trump’s nominee\nBill Pulte as head of the FHFA\n, which collects appraisal records from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Pulte’s stance on Kaegi’s idea is unclear; Pulte is the grandson of the late William Pulte, who started one of the nation’s largest homebuilders, Pulte Homes, in Detroit in the 1950s.\nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency compiles Fannie and Freddie appraisals into a Uniform Appraisal Dataset that contains parcel-level property characteristics. Most of this data is inaccessible to government assessors, but Kaegi and 15 other assessment offices across the country are hoping to change that.\nThe Kaegi-backed proposal’s supporters said it would aid in addressing a common problem encountered by Cook County homeowners: Less expensive homes tend to be overvalued for taxes relative to their actual sale price, while pricier homes tend to be undervalued for taxes in an issue known as “regressivity.”\n\nThis means that working class and low income families end up paying more than their fair share in property taxes or can’t pay at all, putting a strain on the local municipality that relies on property tax revenue to fund public services. This has been\nparticularly true for small towns in the South suburbs of Chicago\nthat have a higher concentration of working class homeowners hit with overvaluations.\n“In recent years, we’ve eliminated a large portion of the regressivity in Cook County’s residential assessments,” Kaegi said in the release. “With the release of this data, we would be able to clear one of the final hurdles to achieving thoroughly fair and accurate assessments.”\nA 2022 University of Chicago\nstudy cited the main causes of regressivity as “limitations in the data and methods used in assessment,” specifically a lack of data about property characteristics that might factor into calculating a property’s assessed value. A study by Josh Myers Valuation Solutions also attributed\nthe undervaluation of commercial properties\n, in part, to “lack of data-sharing.”\nThe resolution got a boost from the National Association of Counties’ Board of Directors, which endorsed the measure in a March 1 annual legislative conference, according to the release. Kaegi’s co-sponsor on the bill is Eddie Cook, the assessor of Maricopa County, Arizona, which includes the city of Phoenix.\n",

CET Holdings is behind the Horizon mixed-use development and Bentley Ridge townhome communities, while Red Seal is advancing its Proximity and SkyVue residential projects. E3 Construction holds the largest land portfolio and is planning four residential projects within the district.\nThe rebranding comes as Texas-based Ewing Properties’\nrecent $200 million listing for The Riverside\n, a 65-acre waterside site slated for a massive $2.5 billion development. Three public parks and 5 million square feet of residential, office and retail space are in the plans. Rob Lowe of Stream Realty is marketing the property.\n\nThe River District lies a few miles from major developments along West Trinity Lane, including the under-construction Titans stadium and Oracle’s planned tech hub and headquarters on the East Bank, set to connect to New City Properties’\nmixed-use redevelopment\nof the Neuhoff meat-packing plant.\nAlso in the East Bank, Carl Icahn’s firm is selling a 45-acre former scrapyard for $225 million. A local investment group led by veteran investors J. David Byerley and Sam Lingo are acquiring the property at a price well above its previous $25 million book value.

    "content": "A LaSalle Street tower is hitting the market, but Chicago’s office market isn’t exactly dealing strong hands.\nBeacon Capital Partners listed its 40-story office tower at 190 South LaSalle Street at a challenging moment for Chicago’s office sector, Crain’s\nreported\n.\nThe property, known as the U.S. Bank Building, is facing potential tenant losses and mounting financial pressure. The price wasn’t disclosed.\nBeacon acquired the nearly 800,000-square-foot tower in late 2019 for $230 million ($288 per square foot) and is selling at a time when Loop office buildings are trading at significant discounts. A $167.5 million mortgage ($209 per square foot) from U.S. Bank also weighs it down — a balance that now likely exceeds the property’s market value amid rising vacancies and declining demand.\nTwo of the building’s largest tenants, Neuberger Berman and Bain &amp; Company, are expected to exit by 2027 and 2028, respectively.\nThe looming vacancies add to the building’s uncertainty despite its anchor tenant U.S. Bank’s signing through 2030. The weighted average lease term across tenants is just over four years, according to marketing materials.\n\nThe sale offer comes after Beacon’s\nloss on 303 East Wacker Drive\n, which sold in December for about $63 million, a steep drop from the $182 million Beacon paid in 2018. Another blow came with a foreclosure lawsuit at 330 North Wabash Avenue, where Beacon faces claims over a $372 million loan after its appraisal\ndropped 62 percent last month\nfrom issuance four years ago.\nBeacon recently invested $13.7 million in renovating 190 South LaSalle, upgrading the lobby, fitness center and conference spaces in hopes of attracting tenants.\nThe building, developed in 1987 and designed by Philip Johnson, is one of the few LaSalle Street properties to undergo significant recent updates. That list includes 135 South LaSalle Street, for which the city doled out $98 million in TIF subsidies to Riverside Investment &amp; Development, DL3 Realty and AmTrust RE to convert vacant office space into 386 residential units\nlast fall\n.\nSeveral nearby towers have fallen into foreclosure, like New York-based landlord Feil Organization’s 10 South LaSalle Street. Feil was\nhit with a foreclosure suit\nby Wilmington Trust in January over contractors’ unpaid mechanics liens.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "A disgraced Venezuelan ex-banker identified in the Panama Papers joins a growing number of South Florida commercial real estate owners feeling the pinch of distress.\nAn entity managed by Eligio Cedeño in Coral Gables filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in Miami federal bankruptcy court on Saturday, two days before its four commercial units at\nBrickell House\ncondominium at 1300 Brickell Bay Drive were scheduled to be sold at a foreclosure auction.\nCedeño’s entity, Ectul Holdings, listed $19 million in assets and $13.3 million in debts, the bankruptcy petition shows. Ectul’s largest creditor is Fort Lauderdale-based Fuse 10, which won a $7.5 million final judgment against the entity in January, Miami-Dade court records show.\nEctul’s bankruptcy attorney Diego Mendez did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn October of last year, Fuse 10 filed a foreclosure complaint against Ectul alleging that the borrower defaulted on a $6 million loan issued in 2023, by missing two monthly interest payments and a payment to its real estate taxes and insurance account that year. Ectul entered into a forbearance agreement that expired in February of last year, the lawsuit alleges. Cedeño’s entity paid $7.5 million for the three commercial units in 2021, records show.\nEctul’s second largest creditor is North Miami Beach-based Blue Waves Investment, which also has a pending\nforeclosure\ncomplaint against the entity. The lawsuit alleges Ectul defaulted on a $5 million loan secured by a Brickell House penthouse also owned by the Cedeño entity. In 2023, Ectul paid $5.2 million for the 3,860-square-foot unit at 1300 Brickell Bay Drive in Miami, records show.\n\nThe sale of the commercial units and the penthouse foreclosure complaint are stayed as a result of the bankruptcy filing.\nCedeño was among a half-dozen Venezuelan banking executives identified in the 2016\nPanama Papers\nas controlling secret offshore accounts, published reports state. Nearly a decade earlier, in 2007, Cedeño was arrested and detained in Venezuela for allegedly breaking the country’s currency laws and allegedly engaging in illegal transactions to obtain U.S. dollars.\nHe was released two years later and fled to the U.S. In 2011, the U.S. government granted Cedeño asylum, according to published reports.\nAcross South Florida, commercial property owners are catching the brunt of market headwinds. This month, a lender slapped Don King with a foreclosure complaint that alleges the legendary boxing promoter defaulted on a\n$5 million\nmortgage secured by a Deerfield Beach warehouse he owns.\nBrooklyn-based investor and Holocaust survivor Zipporah Goldstein is also feeling a lender’s heat. Recently, Troy, Michigan-based Flagstar Bank filed a foreclosure complaint in Miami-Dade County against Goldstein’s entity that owns nine ground-floor commercial units inside a three-story Art Deco building in Miami Beach. Flagstar alleges Goldstein and her entity defaulted on a\n$5.5 million\nloan.\nLast month, a partnership among Miami-based builder Marlon Gomez and Coral Gables-based developers Fausto Callava and Antonio Pardo was hit with a foreclosure complaint alleging the joint venture defaulted on a\n$10 million\nloan secured by a 1.8-acre Miami River development site.",

    "content": "A proposed legal settlement over the botched environmental cleanup of Hunters Point Shipyard would leave thousands of affected residents with just $606 per person.\nA federal judge denied the agreement between developers FivePoint Holdings and Lennar and lawyers behind the $1 billion lawsuit — calling it a “sweetheart deal” for the builders and the “worst settlement” he’s ever seen, the\nSan Francisco Chronicle reported.\nIn a scathing order, U.S. District Judge James Donato called the proposed payout to 6,500 residents of Hunters Point “paltry,” and accused the plaintiff’s lawyers of selling out their clients.\n“No question that the proposed terms are unfair to the class members,” he said during a January hearing.\nResidents of Hunters Point filed a lawsuit in 2018 alleging they were the victims of fraud and had suffered health defects in connection with the former shipyard’s ongoing toxic cleanup.\nIn the latest attempt by Irvine-based FivePoint and Miami-based Lennar to settle, the developers and Sausalito law firm Bonner &amp; Bonner had asked the court to approve a $5.4 million deal.\nBut with $1.4 million for attorney fees and $4 million in community payouts, it worked out to $606 per person. A settlement proposal in 2022 for 9,000 residents, also rejected by the judge, would have worked out to $400 per person.\nDonato accused the residents’ attorneys, Charles and Cabral Bonner, of colluding against Tetra Tech EC, a third defendant in the lawsuit but left out of the settlement talks. The unit of Tetra Tech was hired two decades ago to\nclean hazardous radiation and toxic substances\nfrom the shipyard once owned by the U.S. Navy.\nThe developers and the Bonners had entered into a “common interest agreement,” which allows parties with shared legal interests to share information in order to collaborate on defense strategies. But the judge said the residents and developers are “adverse parties” who cut a deal to target Tetra Tech EC.\nSuch a settlement “becomes collusive when it is aimed to injure the interests” of an absent defendant, Donato said.\n\nThe Bonners have denied wrongdoing, saying they acted in the best interest of their clients by collaborating with the developers. Lennar declined to comment to the Chronicle, while FivePoint didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nSam Singer, a spokesperson for Pasadena-based Tetra Tech EC said: “The judge’s order speaks for itself.”\nAfter signing the common interest agreement, the Bonners amended the residents’ complaint for the sixth time. The changes “drastically narrowed plaintiff’s claims against the home builder defendants, dropped the class allegations against them, and deleted the damages demand of $1 billion,” Donato wrote in his order.\n“The evidence of collusion is striking,” Donato wrote. During the hearing, he questioned why the developers should be allowed to exit a $1 billion lawsuit in exchange for “paying nickels.”\nFivePoint, a spinoff of Lennar, has entitlements for thousands of homes and millions of square feet of commercial space at Hunter’s Point.\nA trial date for the case is set for next year, but the Bonners said they are talking with the developers about another settlement deal, and\nreached out to Tetra Tech EC\nto “see if they are interested in negotiating.”\nTetra Tech EC has faced\nmultiple ongoing lawsuits\nrelated to the cleanup of the 500-acre shipyard site, including a lawsuit filed by the developers in 2020. This year, the U.S. Department of Justice agreed to settle a lawsuit brought against the contractor a decade ago, originally by whistleblowers, for\n$97 million\n, according to the Chronicle.\nThe Navy previously said in other court filings that the “negative fiscal impact” of the fraud at the shipyard is between\n$370 million and $570 million\n.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "A flight to quality by Seattle office tenants could be a boon for Su Development, which plans to build a 23-story apartment tower in Bellevue — now a suburban challenge to the Emerald City.\nThe locally based developer has filed revised plans for a high-rise at 205 105th Ave NE, the\nPuget Sound Business Journal\nand\nDowntown Bellevue Network\nreported. It would replace a shuttered sushi restaurant.\nThe building, dubbed 205 Tower, would contain one of two options — either a 260-foot-tall building with 164 units and 5,000 square feet of shops and restaurants, or a 308-foot building with 173 apartments, with similar retail.\nThe project, designed by locally based MZA, is “an architectural expression of Bellevue’s evolution,” according to the project narrative.\nThat evolution, across Lake Washington from Seattle, includes a growing tech hub that’s now home to eBay, Meta, ByteDance, Oracle, Salesforce, Google, Microsoft and a\nmajor Amazon campus\n.\nSeattle-based\nAmazon.com\nhas 14,000 employees in Bellevue and plans to\nadd 11,000 more\nin the coming years, with downtown poised for more multifamily projects like 205 Tower, according to the Business Journal.\nSu, a vertically integrated design-build firm, is known for its architecturally dazzling projects, including a\ntwo-tower development at Yesler Terrace in Seattle\nand Soma Towers in Bellevue.\n\nIts latest project seeks to capitalize on its location along the Grand Connection, a series of projects designed to uplift the pedestrian experience between Meydenbauer Bay Park through Downtown, and across Interstate 405 to an Eastrail multi-use path.\nThe proposed glass towers at Northeast Second Street and 105th Avenue Northeast contain a sculpted crown atop a five-story podium, with exterior balconies jutting from floor-to-ceiling windows, according to renderings.\nThe first concept draws on the interaction between water and land, highlighting the contrast between Bellevue’s urban landscape and an adjoining park, according to dbNetwork. The second is based on Pacific Northwest stone outcroppings, with a prominent vertical element.\nSu’s project “directly engages” with the Grand Connection with a public plaza along Northeast Second Street, with “retail frontages, seating areas and landscaping to create a dynamic, human-scaled environment,” according to a project filing.\nZoe Wang, project architect for Su, said the company wants to break ground by the end of next year.\nSu, founded in 1981 by John Su, built Downtown Bellevue’s first concrete-and-steel condominium building, and has developed more than 2,400 apartments, according to the Business Journal.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "There is a new development in this story.\nCompass could be continuing its period of expansion with a massive growth spurt in the form of a deal to buy Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices.\nThe Wall Street Journal first\nreported\nthe residential giant was in talks for the country’s fourth-largest brokerage, according to RealTrends.\nTerms of the deal have not yet been reported.\nThe move would be a major step in what has become a 12-month period of rapid consolidation for\nCompass\n, the nation’s largest brokerage by deal volume.\nCompass sent shockwaves through the industry last year when it announced\nits $444 million deal\nto acquire Christie’s International Real Estate and @properties. @properties was the eighth-largest brokerage in the country before the acquisition, according to RealTrends. Robert Reffkin’s firm also scooped up local brokerages in Tennessee and the Gulf Coast last year.\nCompass’ deals for smaller firms and large teams have contributed to its headcount and private listings network. In the firm’s most recent earnings call, Reffkin said 7,500, or 35 percent of the company’s listings, were off-MLS. In February, more than half of new Compass listings started as private exclusives or were available only on Compass.com, which are part of the company’s latest\nconsumer marketing strategy\n.\n\nThe firm also notched its most successful financial year since going public in 2024,  with its share price more than doubling in the last 12 months as it reported its first cash-flow positive year.\nBHHS had 820 brokerage offices and 270 franchises at the end of 2024.\nThe real estate arm of Warren Buffett’s conglomerate entered the New York City market in 2017 but has had a difficult time gaining a foothold since then, ranking 18th in the\nTRD\n’s most recent brokerage rankings.\nElsewhere in the United States, BHHS Chicago boasts a roster of more than 1,300 real estate professionals.\nBerkshire Hathaway HomeServices acquired Ron Shuffield’s EWM Realty International in 2003. The Coral Gables, Florida-based firm, now called BHHS EWM, has more than 700 agents and employees across seven offices in South Florida.\nHomeServices made headlines last year when it\nagreed to pay $250 million\nto settle antitrust lawsuits accusing it of colluding with the National Association of Realtors and other major brokerages to hike agents’ pay. The settlement was the largest payout offered by the brokerage defendants, outpacing the $58 million deal reached by Compass.",

    "content": "As Steve Witkoff dives deeper into the diplomatic world, he’s pulling back on his real estate ties.\nThe business man and President Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East\ndisclosed to Bloomberg\nthat he’s in the process of divesting from the Witkoff Group and World Liberty Financial, the cryptocurrency platform co-founded by Alex and Zach Witkoff. Alex has already assumed day-to-day responsibilities of the development firm, which Steve founded almost 30 years ago.\nWhen Witkoff joined the administration, ethics questions quickly followed considering how much of his business can be tied to places all over the world. In divesting from his firm and crypto assets, Witkoff is hoping to be judged on his diplomatic results going forward.\n“How do you ensure you’re not using the special envoy role to skew policy your way?” Harold Hongju Koh, a former legal adviser to the State Department, told Bloomberg.\nWitkoff and Trump were already enmeshed, business-wise. Both of their families have stakes in World Liberty Financial. Witkoff was also an investor in Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover; Musk leads Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency today.\nNow Witkoff is following Trump’s lead by installing progeny atop a real estate company when entering the political fray, though ethics questions about Trump’s businesses continue to linger.\n\nFederal ethics law mandates senior Cabinet officials divest individual stock holdings and assets that could bring about conflict of interest concerns. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is divesting his business interests, recently\nnaming one of his sons\nas the chair of Cantor Fitzgerald.\nWitkoff’s fortune is estimated to be around $782 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, though one person familiar with his finances suggested it could be double that.\nWitkoff has been especially busy internationally during the first couple of months of Trump’s second administration, and even before then, despite his lack of diplomatic experience. He helped negotiate the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. He also\nmet with Russian president Vladimir Putin\nlast month and will soon do so again.\nIn some ways, he’s following in the footsteps laid out by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Ivanka Trump’s husband jumped from real estate to politics — negotiating the Abraham Accords — before jumping back into business. Kushner’s private equity firm, Affinity Partners, counts $4.6 billion in assets, essentially all\nfrom foreign investors\n.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Matthew Pellar is CEO of TM.\n\nIts portfolio includes the 240-unit Shalimar at Davie complex at 4901 Shalimar Lane in Davie, and the 240-unit Shalimar at Plantation West at 8500 Cleary Boulevard in Plantation.\nIn 2021, TM sold the Lincoln Square office complex consisting of a pair of five-story buildings at  18405 Northwest Second Avenue in Miami Gardens for\n$15.4 million\n.\nSouth Florida’s multifamily market has slowed compared to the boom years of 2021 and 2022 when the tri-county region experienced an influx of out-of-state residents and record rent hikes.

Last month, White Oak Development scored\n$67 million\nto build a pair of four-story buildings with 286 apartments at 4181 and 4233 Davie Road in Davie.

He joined Crescent in 2006 when it operated as Goff Capital Partners before its conversion to Crescent Real Estate in 2016.\nThe firm has also promoted several internal leaders. These include Christopher Goff — Chairman John Goff’s son — to senior managing director, head of capital formation; Andrew Lombardi, who will remain CFO, to senior managing director; Noelle Garsek to managing director, general counsel; and Ben Molk to managing director, office. Joseph Pitchford, managing director of development, will join Crescent’s senior management committee.\nThe leadership shift comes as Crescent expands its footprint across North Texas. The firm manages $4.4 billion in assets and oversees about $225 million in development.\n\nCrescent is raising $250 million for its fourth GP Invitation Fund as it strengthens its development pipeline. The firm’s portfolio includes marquee assets like The Crescent in Uptown Dallas — a 1.3 million-square-foot property with office, retail and hotel components — and the Robert L.

    "content": "Las Vegas Sands’ vision for a destination resort in Irving is facing growing public resistance, with concerns over the proposed casino dominating recent discussions.\nMore than 30 Irving residents spoke against the proposal, criticizing the casino element and raising concerns about the city’s planning process in a Planning and Zoning Commission meeting last week, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe commission is\nconsidering a proposal\nto rezone the 182-acre site owned by Sands to allow for high-density, mixed-use development. Sands acquired 259 acres near the former Texas Stadium in mid-2023.\nThe changes would pave the way for a destination resort featuring a potential casino — pending state legalization — as well as a 15,000-seat arena for the Dallas Mavericks, plus a hotel, retail and entertainment spaces.\nThe debate comes amid broader speculation about the future of the Dallas Mavericks, co-owned by Sands’\nnewly promoted CEO Patrick Dumont\n. Sands bought Mark Cuban’s majority stake in the Mavericks for $3.5 billion at the end of 2023.\nThe rezoning would also establish a baseline development framework, though Sands would need to submit detailed plans for approval later. The proposal is still moving through the early stages. The commission scheduled to revisit it on Monday before a possible city council vote next Thursday.\n\nResidents argued that discussions were being rushed and lacked transparency, with some claiming they first learned of the zoning amendments just 48 hours before the meeting. Others questioned why city leaders would consider approving zoning for a casino while gambling is illegal in Texas.\nSands has said that a casino is essential for the project’s financial viability. Casino revenue is necessary to support other resort amenities like convention space and entertainment venues, the company said.\nThe company plans to have representatives at the upcoming meetings and maintained Sands is committed to “ongoing engagement and collaboration,” spokesman Ron Reese said.\nRemoving casino gaming from the zoning could force Sands to reconsider the development altogether, he said.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "Voucher recipients across Illinois are struggling to find housing as challenges in subsidized housing programs grow, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nMost subsidies come through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Housing Choice Voucher Program, which allows recipients to pay about 30 percent of their income toward rent while local housing authorities cover the rest.\nYet many recipients are unable to lease units due to hurdles including landlords\nrefusing to accept vouchers\n, often due to discrimination, and a lack of inventory.\nThe Chicago Housing Authority’s lease-up rates fell to 31 percent last year, down from 45 percent in 2023. The figure ranged from 61 percent to 77 percent between 2019 and 2022.\nSimilarly, the North Chicago Housing Authority reported a 50 percent lease-up rate last year, while the Lake County Housing Authority logged 62 percent. Some recipients are still searching for homes, meaning these rates could shift.\nThe struggle to find housing can be grueling for voucher holders, who may have to sleep in their cars or couch surf, shower at the gym and store personal items at work. Once they are approved for vouchers, the clock is ticking, and time can run out before they find housing.\n\nSome housing authorities are adopting strategies to address the problems. Housing authorities in Waukegan, North Chicago and Lake County last year agreed to allow voucher holders to lease units in any of their jurisdictions, aiming to expand options and increase lease-up rates.\nWaukegan and Lake County have also received HUD approval to offer monetary incentives to landlords.\nMeanwhile, landlords cite barriers like bureaucratic delays, inspections and a lack of standardization across housing authorities. Some housing providers have called for streamlining the process through faster unit approvals and more consistent administrative standards.\nNationally, about 60 percent of voucher holders are able to lease units, according to New York University’s Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy.\nThe rates are lower in markets with older housing stock and among recipients of color — two conditions that especially apply in Chicago.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "When Tony Prophet joined Salesforce as its chief equality officer in 2016, he wanted the “real urban experience of living in San Francisco,” which he didn’t associate with the city’s\ntraditional high-end neighborhoods\non the north side of town. Instead he went into\nSoMa\n, “eyes wide open,” buying a 7,000-square-foot top-floor condo at 9 Bernice Street for just over $7 million in November 2016.\n“No surprises,” he said of his time living with his then-wife and their son at the semi-industrial location near Rainbow Grocery and the DNA Lounge. “We knew everything—all the good and the challenges that we were in for—and saw some real improvements along the way.”\nNearly a decade later and with more than $1 million poured into creating a wind-shielded roof deck with astroturf and a fire pit, Prophet is hoping his condo will break West SOMA residential records, with an asking price of $8.8 million.\nA price of about $1,250 per square foot is not out of step for the neighborhood. But because there are not many condos or even single-family homes as big as 9 Bernice, there are seldom sales above $5 million. So while it’s “impossible to replicate what’s been done here,” according to Compass agent Butch Haze, who is listing the skylit two-level loft with three bedrooms, 3.5 baths, a wine room, and a glass-enclosed gym, it’s also nearly impossible to find comps.\n“You really have to compare it to buying a warehouse and what it would take to do the TIs,” he said, adding that the turnkey aspect is “baked in” to the asking price.\nThere are added perks as well. The condo includes the elaborate light fixtures and large-scale furniture, almost entirely from Restoration Hardware, including a 16-seat dining table that was craned in by the previous owner, luxury retailer Wilkes-Bashford co-owner Tyler Mitchell.\n\n“Not everyone loves Restoration Hardware, but nobody hates it,” said Prophet, who built on interior designer Ken Fulk’s work for Mitchell.\nThe new price marks a big drop from the last time the condo was on the market in 2022, when it was listed at just under $11 million. The home didn’t find a buyer at the time, but Prophet had already moved to Florida so his son could attend IMG, a sports academy about an hour south of Tampa. For the last two years, he has rented it to a foursome of entrepreneurs from the start up world. Haze said the new price had to speak to today’s “value-driven buyer.”\n“We wanted to price it where the price per square foot is just too attractive,” Haze said.\nThere are a lot of early stage businesses walking distance from the property, Prophet added, which borders the Mission, Potero Hill and the Design District. The “perfect fit” would be someone who is excited by the idea of walking to work and entertaining in the enormous space, he said.\nProphet said he hosted everything from fundraisers for London Breed and the Women’s HIV Program at UCSF to media events for Salesforce during his time there. He left Salesforce in 2021, and now sits on the board at Dolby Labs and is an investor and board member for an AI-assisted sales platform called Aviso.\nThe likely buyer for this home probably also sits on a lot of boards, Haze said, and is in their 50s or 60s but still active in tech or finance. They probably already own more traditional homes outside the city, but are looking for something different. It may be somebody that has “flirted with” the north side of the city or Noe Valley, but can’t pass up the outside-the-box offering.\n“They want to have fun in a really cool, almost superhero lair in San Francisco that wows all their friends,” he said.\nThat’s a very specific buyer profile, but Prophet said he can be patient until the right person comes along.\n“It’s super special for someone who sees that opportunity,” he said. “It was the same situation when we bought it: a unique property and a high price point.”\n",

    "content": "The first to retreat was Beverly Hills, which laid down its arms in the battle against the state builder’s remedy.  And now La Cañada Flintridge, which threw in the towel after a two-year fight.\nThe La Cañada Flintridge City Council voted to withdraw from its campaign to block a five-story apartment-hotel-office project proposed by Cedar Street Partners under the anti-NIMBY law at 600 Foothill Boulevard, the\nLos Angeles Daily News\nand\nBisnow\nreported.\nThe reason: the foothill city chose to quit an uphill legal battle after a Los Angeles judge ordered it pay a $14 million bond to appeal\na court decision to greenlight the project\n.\n“Continuing the lawsuits is no longer in the best interest of the city,” Mayor Mike Davitt said in a\nstatement\nsaying that the financial costs of its appeal outweighed its potential outcome.\nThe decision by La Cañada Flintridge to back down may mark a Waterloo for opponents of the builder’s remedy, a once-obscure provision in state housing law that has empowered developers while frustrating cities and counties across the state.\nThe builder’s remedy allows housing developers to skirt local zoning\nin cities such as Beverly Hills\nthat failed to certify their state-mandated housing plans, provided their projects include 20 percent affordable housing.\nBeverly Hills, which had vigorously fought a slew of state-sanctioned builders remedy projects,\nbroached a compromise\nwith developers last month.\nNow La Cañada Flintridge must come to terms with Cedar Street, led by Jonathan Curtis, a former city councilman and mayor who bought the property during his term in office.\nThe locally based developer had employed the 35-year-old legal loophole to allow the 80-unit complex with 16 hotel rooms and 7,300 square feet of offices, with 16 apartments set aside for low-income households.\n\nThe project, designed by Mid-City-based Riley Projects, would replace a former First Church of Christ Scientist, blocks from a large commercial district.\nCedar Street Partners had filed a\nlawsuit in July 2023\n, after a yearlong back-and-forth with the city and repeated denials. Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta\nasked a court\nto support the project, as well as the state builder’s remedy provision.\nThe decision by the city to back down sends a disquieting message to cities trying to push back against housing laws, Ryan Leaderman, a partner at Holland &amp; Knight, who previously represented the 600 Foothill project, told Bisnow.\n“The message is: stop playing games with housing,” Leaderman said. “There’s going to be a price to pay when a city unlawfully denies a project.”\nDespite the city’s decision to abandon its appeal, the Foothill Boulevard project must still clear several hurdles before winning local approval. While the builder’s remedy waives zoning rules, such projects still must comply with environmental, infrastructure and health and safety standards, according to the Daily News.\n“The City and community will need to chart a pathway forward that integrates the 600 Foothill project as reasonably as possible, and we hope going forward the developer will work with us to minimize any detrimental impacts on the City,” Mayor Davitt said in his statement.\n“The ball’s in their court,” Cedar Street partner Jonathan Curtis told Bisnow.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Two major San Francisco apartment building trades by longtime owners have closed in the first few months of the year, including the $35 million sale of the block-long Normandy Apartments, just behind the famed St. Mary’s Cathedral.\nThe early spring sales are further signs of\nnew life in the market\nthat agents saw beginning in the latter half of last year.\nThe seller of the 1968-built 108-unit complex at 1135-1175 Ellis Street was a partnership called Normandy Apartments that goes back to at least the 1990s, according to city records. The buyer was affordable housing developer Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation, which bought the property with funding from the San Francisco Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development and is planning a major renovation. The MOHCD confirmed the $35 million price.\nThe Jan. 31 acquisition will create “permanently affordable units in the City’s Western Addition neighborhood for families, individuals, couples, older adults, and long-term residents within a variety of ethnic and racial backgrounds,” according to a TNDC announcement. With the exception of one manager’s unit, all apartments will be restricted to households not to exceed 120 percent of the city’s area median income with an average of 80 percent of the city’s AMI. In 2024, 80 percent of AMI would mean that a single person making up to $83,900 would be eligible, for example, while a household with three people could make up to $107,900, according to the MOHCD website.\nA November 2024 MOHCD memo about TNDC’s request for just over $52 million in permanent financing for the purchase and rehabilitation of the nearly 70,000-square-foot property said the building is in “good condition” and 90 percent occupied. The planned rehabilitation will focus on fire and life safety upgrades and accessibility and ADA upgrades and requirements.\nColliers agent Brad Lagomarsino represented the sellers and said that TNDC and MOHCD “seized the rare opportunity to purchase 108 units in the heart of San Francisco”. He added that the nearly 1.5-acre lot  “offers tremendous development potential that justifies the price paid for the asset.”\n\nIn another early spring sale after a decades-long hold, a 36-unit Nob Hill apartment building traded for the first time since it was built in 1954, according to public records. The price was $14.5 million, or just over $400,000 per unit, according to the transfer tax on the sale. That’s above the average of about $340,000 per unit in San Francisco in 2024, according to Colliers data.\nColliers listing agent Dustin Dolby said he could not comment on the Feb. 18 sale due to a non-disclosure agreement, but he posted on LinkedIn that, “With its proximity to Grace Cathedral, Huntington Park, and the Financial District, 1330 Jones exemplifies the enduring desirability of Nob Hill real estate.”\nThe sellers were the descendants of the developer, Theo G. Meyer and Sons, which built the seven-story building, according to the deed and probate records. The buyer was Otrera Real Estate, LLC, a Delaware-created entity that lists its address as a P.O. Box at the Rincon Finance Center in downtown San Francisco, according to the deed. The buyers’ agent is unknown.\nThe six-story building at 1330 Jones has 18 one-bedroom, one-bath units, six two-bedroom, one-bath units, and 12 two-bedroom, two-bath units, as well as 23 dedicated parking spots and onsite laundry.\nThe building was first listed as part of a\nthree-building portfolio\nthat was all developed by the Meyer family and came to market at an undisclosed price last summer. It is the smallest building of the three, and the only one to sell thus far. The other two buildings are a 62-unit, 13-story building at 1000 Green Street in Russian Hill and the 56-unit, 13-story Crest Royal at 1310 Jones, which is next door to the building that sold.\nAt least two other San Francisco apartment buildings asking over $10 million are also in contract but are still pending. Magnolia Place, which has 27 apartment units at 3322 Buchanan in the Marina, came to market at the end of September with an asking price of $18 million. The 2001-built non-rent-controlled building with two commercial units fronting Lombard Street has been pending as of Nov. 22, according to Redfin. At 1745 Market, a property with 48 apartment units and eight commercial spaces, including local favorite piano bar Martuni’s, went into contract on Jan. 27, according to Redfin. It is owned by\nMosser Properties\nand has been\non and off the market for the last few years\n, with a starting price of $25 million in 2022. It came back to market most recently last September, with an asking price of $14 million. That ask dropped to $13 million in November, just $1 million more than Mosser paid for it back in 2017.\n",

    "content": "A Grayslake-based real estate company whose manager reportedly paid an unhoused Chicagoan to take over the deeds of run-down properties it picked up in bulk and later sought to offload has become the latest target of the city.\nThe company, Goldmine Investments, and another Hinsdale-based investor, QCD Financial, follow a pattern of owners being pursued by a city task force that’s designed to pin down Chicago’s most indebted landowners. Both firms are alleged large-scale “land speculators” that bought up heavily distressed properties, often vacant lots, purchasing them under the names of various LLCs used to muddy the ownership of the properties, according to complaints filed by the city in Cook County Circuit Court.\nThey collectively owe $9 million in fines to the city from municipal code violations related to neglect and environmental hazards at their properties, which are predominantly concentrated in disadvantaged neighborhoods on the South and West sides of the city.\nThis is when “land speculation becomes problematic,” the city said in the case brought against QCD.\nFor its most negligent landowners, the Chicago Department of Law’s special collections unit is moving to consolidate judgements made against owners in city administrative hearings into lawsuits filed with the Circuit Court — as it did for QCD, Goldmine and\ninfamous Chicago landowner Suzie Wilson\nin recent months. The city recently reached a tentative, $11.5 million settlement agreement with Wilson to resolve an estimated $49 million in legal claims it brought against her and her companies.\nAfter bringing down Wilson, the city “seized an opportunity once we learned that there was an individual — individuals — who are accumulating property in a particularly unique way around these title structures that allow them to constantly change the titles without anyone in the city or the county noticing that was happening,” Chicago’s top lawyer Mary Richardson-Lowry said.\nNow, the unit is doing more research to track ownership and moving aggressively when they can bring legal action against the people behind the landlord LLCs — and officials are open to seeking to freeze personal assets in some circumstances as a “motivator,” said the city’s deputy attorney David Holtkamp, who runs the unit.\nNext on the city’s list of troubling landowners: Grayslake resident Keith Moll, the manager of Goldmine, according to court filings and business registry information.\nDigging into Goldmine\nThe city says that Goldmine owns hundreds of properties in Chicago and is just “one of many shell companies created by (Moll) to hold title to real estate in distressed neighborhoods.” Goldmine allegedly owes the city over $5.2 million in fines from more than 1,500 counts of blight-related code violations, according to city litigation.\nThis is not the first time that an LLC managed by Moll has been sued by the city, according to a\nChicago Tribune report from 2015\n. The city sued Z Financial Illinois G Properties, LLC a decade ago to force the company to repair, demolish or cover the cost of demolishing unsafe structures on its properties.\nShortly thereafter, Moll transferred ownership of several of the properties to an unhoused man named Abana Tabb, who told the newspaper Moll paid him to take the five properties.\n“(He said) ‘I wanna dump a couple of houses on you. Don’t worry about it. You’re not gonna get in trouble, blah, blah, blah … sign here,’” Tabb told the newspaper.\nAs a result, Tabb was added as a defendant in the city’s cases against the properties and Z Financial was let off the hook in nearly every case. The Cook County Sheriff’s Office later investigated the transfers, but ultimately closed the case without filing any charges.\nZ Financial acquired the properties through the county’s delinquent tax and scavenger sales — a high-risk, high-reward investment arena.\nTax buyers used to be able to earn double-digit interest rates as residents paid back taxes — they can still earn significant interest after state law was\nrecently reformed\nto lower the maximum rates to cut a break to homeowners who fall behind. But when those taxes aren’t repaid and the deed is turned over to the taxbuyer, investors like Moll can end up with a lot of properties that are worth less — or would cost more to repair — than they paid for them.\nMoll didn’t return requests for comment made by\nThe Real Deal\nvia phone and email.\nTransferring property in this way is not illegal and Moll told the Tribune that he gave the properties to Tabb because the man expressed a desire to rehabilitate and live in them. But a co-defendant in a recent city lawsuit filed against Goldmine, Damien Garrett Chiodo, said this instance of it is unethical, if true.\n“I don’t know these guys. For all I know, they’re good guys and got themselves in just a pickle,” Chiodo said. “But I do know it smells bad.”\nChiodo said he became aware of Goldmine when he received notice that he was named in a city lawsuit filed against Goldmine, Moll, himself and Novacore, LLC — an Arizona-based company, now inactive, formerly managed by Chiodo and others, according to court records and business registry information.\nThe complaint, which came in December as the city restarted gunning for Moll, centers around two neighboring properties in the South Shore neighborhood that the city claimed owners allowed to become “an illegal parking lot and dumping ground for abandoned vehicles and refuse.”\n\nNow, this is where things get tricky.\nUntil 2014, a single-family home straddled the line between the two properties at 7543 and 7545 South Oglesby, so they were typically bought and sold together, but had two separate property identification numbers with the county.\nIn 2003, the then-owner of the property transferred the ownership to someone new and signed a deed for both properties that was only recorded against the property identification number for 7543 South Oglesby. The other property, 7545 South Oglesby, was later sold at a scavenger sale, creating a whole different chain of ownership for that parcel.\nMoll’s other company, Z Financial Illinois G Properties, bought 7545 South Oglesby in 2011 and then transferred it to Goldmine via quit claim deed in 2017, property records show. Novacore acquired 7543 S. Oglesby through a quit claim deed in 2014, a deed that also included the property description of the neighboring lot.\nThe two properties have been in a state of neglect that the city claims is an environmental hazard to the neighborhood since 2023. So, when notices of code violations weren’t met with compliance, the city filed suit against both companies and the people they could tie to them, including Chiodo.\nChiodo, who is now the president of KeyLink, a company that helps manage distressed real estate assets for clients like banks and hedge funds, said he did not receive notice of the violations sent to the business because it has been dissolved. Arizona business registry information shows that the LLC has been inactive since 2019.\nThe city asked the court to order that the defendants in the case clean up the properties immediately and is seeking $4.35 million in damages, based on complaints that the owners of the properties used it as an illegal parking lot for abandoned vehicles and failed to put up required fencing or take down a falling tree, creating an environmental hazard for residents in the area.\nWhen he received notice of the suit, Chiodo said he paid to clean up the sites as requested and is hoping to clear things up with the city as soon as possible.\n“We had no idea we even owned the thing, and we’re just trying to make it right and get out from under this mess,” Chiodo said.\nMeanwhile, Moll is unlikely to be absolved anytime soon as the city has moved to consolidate three cases brought against Goldmine Investments to be litigated together in Circuit Court.\nQCD Financial\nHinsdale-based investor QCD Financial has been found liable “at least 1,618 times” for municipal code violations across 125 properties it owns, allegedly amassing over $3.8 million in fines and interest since 2013, according to court records.\nQCD has been operating in Chicago for at least the last 11 years, and the city has been slapping the landowner with health and safety violations ever since, court records show. The company currently owns at least 123 properties across the South and West sides of the city, according to a map compiled by the city.\nA Circuit Court judge granted a city motion that was filed in December to consolidate past judgements made against QCD into a single case. In the coming months, the court will weigh in on the central question that remains before the two parties: how will QCD pay its debts to the city?\nAttempts to reach QCD weren’t successful.\nA spokesperson for the Chicago Department of Law declined to comment on the specifics of the cases brought against QCD and Goldmine in recent months, but confirmed that the city’s special collections unit had taken “additional enforcement actions” against the two companies.\nThe city’s special collections unit is a group of attorneys housed under the Law Department’s Collections, Ownership, and Administrative Litigation Division that evolved out of lessons the division learned while tracking and enforcing the debt racked up by another Chicago landowner Suzie Wilson, Holtkamp said.\nWilson racked up over $15 million in fines for municipal property violations and may be barred from ever investing in Chicago real estate again as part of any settlement that might be reached in a bankruptcy case filed by her businesses in the fall, Holtkamp said. The two sides will meet to discuss the proposed settlement on April 1. It remains uncertain whether the final agreement will include a ban on investing in Chicago.\nAs the city’s special task force ramps up its work, it will start by focusing on about 10 more landowners that hit a certain threshold of unpaid fines and fees with the city, including QCD and Goldmine.\n",

The two-phase project will replace former county probation offices.\nIt also may be first of its kind to use S-13 to streamline approvals and shorten development, according to the Business Times.\nThe S-13 zone allows 100 percent affordable housing projects to bypass environmental and discretionary review, while allowing an additional bonus height, if they meet certain objectives.\nWhile it can help developers get projects approved a year sooner than state streamlining laws like Senate Bill 35 and Assembly Bill 2011, it’s three years faster than a traditional planning application.\nThe three buildings are part of a larger plan to remake Jack London Square with hundreds of affordable homes around a plaza containing a playground, public art and seating.\n\nThe developers plan to spend the next two years raising money to build the project, likely from Measure U Affordable Housing Infrastructure Bond funds, local funding and state financing in tax credits and bonds, according to the Business Times.\nA cost and timeline for the development were not disclosed.\nA later phase, also by Related and East Bay Asian Local Development, would add two affordable apartment buildings and a market-rate complex at 401 Broadway.

CrowdStreet is evolving,” said a spokesperson for CrowdStreet.\nSparrough played a key role in CrowdStreet’s relationships with institutional clients, leading the company’s capital markets team that sourced and selected deals for the platform.\nSparrough oversaw the origination and closing of over $1.7 billion in equity across more than 100 real estate investments, according to his LinkedIn. He accepted a new position with O’Connor Capital Partners as the head of capital formation.\n\nThe platform has come under pressure from investors because of the Elie Schwartz fiasco. Nightingale Properties CEO Elie Schwartz recently pleaded\nguilty\nto one count of wire fraud where Schwartz acknowledged misappropriating $54 million of CrowdStreet investor funds designated for an acquisition of an office complex in Atlanta and a commercial property in Miami Beach. Schwartz faces up to 20 years in prison.\nInvestors have turned their eye on CrowdStreet in light of Schwartz’s guilty plea. A group of about\n125 investors\nin a Nightingale office project in Chicago filed a claim in arbitration demanding CrowdStreet cover $7.2 million in losses, alleging the firm failed to see clear issues with Nightingale and Schwartz, according to Bisnow.\nCrowdStreet has claimed to be a victim of Schwartz’s fraud and alerted authorities about the wrongdoing.\nIn the summer of 2023, an independent manager for investors in Nightingale’s projects announced in a webinar that most of their money had been misappropriated. Schwartz allegedly used that money for personal expenses and other Nightingale projects. He used $12 million of investor funds to bet on First Republic\nbank’s stock\nand options prior to the bank’s seizure by regulators.\nCrowdStreet came under scrutiny because it failed to require Schwartz to hold the money in a designated escrow account.\nCrowdStreet’s long-time CEO\nTore Steen\nleft the firm weeks after the news of the Nightingale scandal broke. Last year, the firm hired John Imbriglia as the CEO who replaced an interim chief executive.\nSparrough did not return a request to comment.\nCorrection\n:\nA previous version of the story\nmisidentified the name of CrowdStreet’s former chief investment officer\n.\n",

Codes for new and rebuilt properties in high-risk fire zones now\nrequire significant measures\n, including ignition-resistant materials and multipaned or window upgrades.\n\nThe Berkeley IGS poll found broad backing for a number of policy ideas, including those that would increase taxes to pay for fire protection and build higher-density housing in urban areas.\nThe most popular proposal, with 84% support, was for policymakers to prioritize assistance for low- and middle-income families displaced by the fires.\nNearly two-thirds of voters polled wanted to provide greater funding for city and county fire departments even if that meant raising taxes.\nThe Berkeley IGS poll was conducted online in English and Spanish on Feb. 17-26 among 5,184 registered voters in L.A. County. The survey’s estimated margin of error is 2 percentage points, and larger for demographic subgroups.\nA 2019 Berkeley IGS poll\nsaw support from three-quarters of California voters\n, including 79 percent in L.A. County, for imposing limits on growth in wildfire areas, according to the Times.\nA poll last year from the Los Angeles Business Council Institute\nfound 81 percent of city voters\nbacked speeding approvals for apartment buildings with some affordable housing near public transit and existing high-density, urban areas.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Contract activity in Los Angeles County staged a comeback, with the condominium market last week leading the way out of a sluggish period.\n“This week’s report is all about condos, with our return to normal volumes being bolstered by the $48.2 million in condo contracts signed last week,” said agent Marcy Roth about the Douglas Elliman Eklund Gomes team’s weekly contracts report.\nEklund Gomes’ roundup counts listings on the MLS of $4 million or more.\nCondos, while typically commanding a large share of contracts on any given week, managed to “dominate the market,” said Roth, an Eklund Gomes team member, with an average price listing price of $9.6 million last week across five properties.\nThat compared with single-family residential’s $99.9 million in volume across 17 contracts, according to the Eklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles.\nOn an average price-per-square-foot basis, the condo segment continued to maintain its edge over single-family homes. Condos that went into contract last week had an average price per square foot of $2,277. Single-family contracts last week equated to an average of $1,344 per square foot.\nIn all, last week ended with 22 properties going into contract, totaling $148.2 million in asking dollar volume. That’s up from the slowdown of the past couple weeks, with the prior seven-day period ended March 2\nyielding 13 contracts good for $75.8 million\nin listing price volume.\nWest Hollywood’s\n8899 Beverly residences\nsaw the combined units of 7B/7E go into contract. The property is listed at just under $16 million.\n\nProperty and state records indicate the seller is a San Mateo, Calif.-registered LLC named after the building’s address.\nBrett Oppenheim of Oppenheim Real Estate holds the listing.\nThe property has three bedrooms and five bathrooms across 5,370 square feet, according to the listing. Standouts of the space include panoramic views, 11-foot sliding glass doors, wraparound balconies and over $1 million pumped into upgrades.\nLast week’s second-largest contract based on listing price was another condo, unit 2302 inside The Carlyle.\nColdwell Banker Realty’s\nJade Mills\nand Emanuele Rizzo have the listing located at 10776 West Wilshire Boulevard with a $14.5 million asking price.\nRecords show the unit was last sold in 2014, when Richard and Roselee Benaron bought the property for $7.9 million.\nThe three-bed, five-bath home in L.A.’s Westwood neighborhood is nearly 5,200 square feet and commands a half floor at the building. The unit touts views of the city and ocean, a private elevator, 10- to 12-foot ceilings and a veranda.\n",

    "content": "A law firm lease will bring Hines’ Texas Tower to 99 percent leased.\nSkadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom leased 52,000 square feet spanning two full floors at 845 Texas Avenue, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The lease will begin in April 2026, but the terms weren’t otherwise disclosed.\nThe deal leaves just 18,000 square feet available in the 47-story, 1.2 million-square-foot tower, which is co-owned by Houston-based Hines and Ivanhoe Cambridge. Savills’ Mark O’Donnell represented the tenant, and Michael Anderson of Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented the landlords.\nThe lease follows Hines’\nlanding a rare $450 million refinancing\nearlier this month, marking the first time in two years a multi-tenant office tower outside New York City was financed through the CMBS single-asset, single-borrower market.\nSkadden will move from its 24,000-square-foot space at 1000 Louisiana Street, Wells Fargo Plaza.\nThat 71-story tower was built in 1983. Its owner, MetLife, plans to spend $138,000 to remodel its 900-square-foot\namenity space\nfor an arcade game room to lure tenants after adding a golf simulator last year. It is also adding a restaurant, bar and tenant lounge, according to the building’s website.\nTexas Tower opened in 2021 and is among the city’s most leased Class A office towers. Other tenants, with Hines’ global headquarters, include law firms Vinson &amp; Elkins, Clifford Chance and DLA Piper as well as Cheniere Energy, Morgan Stanley and coworking space The Square.\n\nThe tower includes two restaurants managed by Berg Hospitality Group. The Sylvie, a French bistro, opened last year. Seafood restaurant Dune Road was set to open last year but hasn’t yet delivered.\nIt also features amenities like underfloor air conditioning, private terraces and a 9,600-square-foot amenity center with a lounge and conference space.\nThe tower’s leasing success highlights the “flight-to-quality” trend, Hines senior managing director John Mooz said.\nClass A inventory has tightened in the city as tenants opt to lease where amenities are enticing enough to lure and retain workers. Older buildings have suffered as a result. The office vacancy rate remains high; it was up to 25.7 percent in the fourth quarter, according to CoStar.\nHouston’s office pipeline has 1.9 million square feet of space under development, about tied with Los Angeles as of January, according to data from CommercialEdge cited by\nCommercialCafe\n. Dallas has 2.8 million square feet underway, and Austin has 3.6 million, the second-most in the nation behind Boston.\nThe drop in office output from previous years across southern markets will likely have a positive effect on occupancy rates, especially as more employers initiate return-to-office mandates, the site said.\n— Judah Duke\n",

Horton picked up a 30-acre parcel along Davis Road in League City, according to a news release from Colliers.\nThe seller was Houston-based Broad Reach Capital, deed records show. Colliers’ Chris Hutcheson, Harrison Kane and James Kadlick represented Broad Reach Capital.\nThe purchase came on the heels of a\ntender offer\nfrom Forestar. The company offered shareholders cash to purchase outstanding 3.85 percent senior notes due. Forestar received offers for 83 percent of the notes, amounting to $329.4 million.\nOther big names in development have also been turning dirt for single-family development in League City.\nHillwood Communities started construction on Legacy by Hillwood, between Interstate 45 and FM 528, a year ago. It was the Dallas-based developer’s third community in the Houston area.\n\nAt full build-out, the 805-acre community will feature 1,600 homes, an elementary school and amenities like pools, a recreation center and launch areas for kayaks and paddleboards.\nLike other far-flung suburbs of major Texas cities, League City is experiencing a wave of growth. In 15 years, its population has nearly tripled to 122,000 people; 40 percent of the city is still undeveloped.\nThe city is preparing for an influx of development with drainage improvements to address flooding and by upgrading the League City waterline, which comes from Houston.\nForestar sold more than 15,000 residential lots last year. The company operates in 24 states, according to its website, but its focus is on communities in the Sunbelt. D. R. Horton acquired a majority stake in Forestar in 2017.\n",

    "content": "The owners of scores of torched homes from Altadena to the Pacific Palisades are cashing out.\nA forecast landslide of listings related to the January firestorms that burned more than\n12,000 homes\nin Los Angeles County has picked up speed,\nthe Los Angeles Times reported\n.\nIn late January, the first vacant lot was put up for sale in Altadena. Then more than a dozen lots were listed last month in the Pacific Palisades for\nbetween $2 million and $8 million\n, with the first lot closing at $1.2 million.\nNow the floodgates appear to have opened, according to the Times. Owners of blackened lots are increasingly choosing to sell rather than slog through the time-consuming and costly task of rebuilding.\n“There [are] so many to choose from,” Jeremy Hardy, a broker with Craig Estates &amp; Fine Properties, told the Times.\nAs of early Monday, there were 49 burned lots listed in Pacific Palisades, and 32 up for sale in Altadena, according to Zillow.\nThe reasons for choosing to sell are varied, real estate agents say. Some owners don’t think they have the money to rebuild, while others are aging and don’t want their last years tied up with construction.\n\nSome with rental properties concluded that keeping them wasn’t worth the hassle.\nMost of those interested in acquiring the burned lots are developers, agents say. Builders generally have the cash to buy vacant land. They can also put up with time, aggravation and costs associated with construction.\n“Building a house is one of the most complex and highly regulated activities you possibly can engage in,” Brock Harris, a Keller Williams agent with the first scorched lot listing in Altadena, which sold to a builder, told the Times.\nA rush by developers could help neighborhoods build back quicker.\nThey’re also raising concerns about gentrification and whether longtime owners are getting a fair price for their lots. In\nmiddle-class Altadena\n, residents proclaimed, “Altadena is not for sale.”\nAt least eight burned lots have been sold in the area with most selling for between $500,000 and $600,000, according to Zillow. Agents said the lots are going for two-thirds of what the typical land fetched before the fire.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",
