    "content": "The Chetrit Group’s struggle with a $481 million loan dating back to before the pandemic is pushing two of the country’s biggest banks into a legal battle.\nWells Fargo sued JPMorgan Chase and Meyer Chetrit to recover losses linked to the 2019 loan originated by Jamie Dimon’s bank, Reuters\nreported\n. Wells Fargo is demanding JPMorgan rectify issues with the loan by either repurchasing it or paying damages.\nNone of the parties involved provided additional comment on the lawsuit.\nJPMorgan provided the massive loan in 2019 to\nfund Chetrit’s acquisition\nof 43 multifamily properties spread across 10 states. The acquisition totaled $522 million according to Wells Fargo, which is acting as a trustee for investors involved in the deal.\nWells Fargo alleges that before the deal closed, JPMorgan Chase and Chetrit discovered the portfolio’s seller overstated the historical net operating income of the properties by 25 percent. That didn’t deter JPMorgan Chase, according to the complaint, putting investors at risk who would go on to purchase pieces of the portfolio, leading to tens of millions in losses.\n\n“JPM had an obligation to engage in due inquiry to determine the scope of the fraudulent reporting,” Wells Fargo stated in the complaint.\nChetrit ultimately defaulted on the loan in 2022. The developer still owes $285 million on the debt, according to the complaint; Meyer Chetrit provided a loan guaranty.\nThe debt has already caused plenty of trouble for Chetrit. Last year, the Indiana attorney general\nfiled a lawsuit\nagainst the developer, alleging the default led to an “unmitigated disaster” for tenants in the state who suffered from maintenance problems.\nChetrit had hoped to pay off the balance of the loan a couple of years ago, shortly after beginning to\nchip away\nat the debt. In November 2022, it paid down $100 million on the debt. It also started to reach deals to sell buildings in the portfolio, which suffered from below-average occupancy rates.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "Lafayette, a city of $2 million homes, has played a shell game with state housing regulators to avoid building its share of affordable housing.\nThat’s the contention of the Housing Action Coalition, a San Francisco-based housing advocate that is suing the East Bay city for creating “misleading and unrealistic housing sites” to satisfy state-mandated housing goals,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported\n.\nThe lawsuit seeks a court to compel the city to adopt a revised plan with an update to its zoning laws. The city must rezone to build 2,114 homes, 943 of them affordable, by 2031.\nThe coalition accuses the city of “pretending” to comply with the planning blueprint, known as the housing element, required of every city and county across the state every eight years.\nLafayette’s alleged shell game includes relying on faith-based institutions and longtime businesses with no plans to develop housing as potential building sites for homes, according to the complaint filed by Farella Braun and Martel a San Francisco-based law firm.\nIn one case, the city said a CVS will be torn down and rebuilt into 26 homes — but CVS has a long-term lease, with no intention of moving, according to the lawsuit. Other examples were not disclosed.\n“We hoped that Lafayette would take its responsibility to plan for housing seriously, but instead, they passed a housing element that deliberately ignores the facts,” Ali Sapirman, the advocacy and policy manager with the Housing Action Coalition, told the Chronicle. “Lafayette is continuing a pattern of obstruction, using questionable calculations to block much-needed housing while pretending to comply with state law.\n“The housing crisis is severe, and every city, including Lafayette, must do its fair share,” Sapirman added.\n\nIn its housing plan, Lafayette proposed using city-owned parking lots for housing, as well as sites downtown and at religious institutions to build affordable housing. The city projects that 27 accessory dwelling units will be built each year, for a total of 216 units.\nOfficials also said more than 150 units were under construction, with another 570 approved units in the development pipeline.\nThe city didn’t immediately return a request for comment by the newspaper.\nLafayette was once a battleground for the region’s housing wars, with two lawsuits, a ballot referendum and more than 100 public hearings that delayed a 315-unit apartment building for almost a dozen years.\nLast year, the\nstate Supreme Court declined\nto hear an appeal from a neighborhood group attempting to stop the development, allowing it to move forward. The project has not broken ground.\nWithin a 10-year span, 115 homes were built in the city of 25,000 residents, including 10 in 2010, 76 in 2018 and 29 in 2019 — according to its housing element plan.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "A lender is going toe-to-toe with Don King, alleging the Donald Trump loving boxing promoter defaulted on a $5.3 million mortgage.\nAn affiliate of Miami-based Blueprint Capital Partners filed a foreclosure complaint in Broward County Circuit Court against King and his entity Fairway Enterprises that owns a 46,467-square-foot warehouse at 501 Fairway Drive in\nDeerfield Beach\n, court records and real estate database Vizzda show. Blueprint Capital alleges that King stopped making interest-only payments in August.\nKing did not respond to requests for comment.\n“I don’t care if you’re Don King or Mike Tyson, if you don’t pay your obligations, you’re going to get sued,” said David Haber, Blueprint Capital’s attorney. “In this case, they weren’t met and we had to file a foreclosure action.”\n\nFairway purchased the 4.4-acre industrial property for $3 million in 2000, records show. The building was completed in 1985. Two years ago, the entity obtained a $5.1 million loan from a previous lender that was increased by $200,000 in 2024 and personally guaranteed by King, the complaint states. Also last year, Blueprint Capital acquired the mortgage.\nA Boca Raton homeowner, the 93-year-old sports icon is among the 45th and 47th president’s most famous supporters. In a December Instagram post, King declared\nTrump\nwas “God sent; and people chosen, made the greatest political comeback in the history of America!!” Recently, King posted a selfie photo of himself wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat alongside\nElon Musk\n, the world’s richest man who is leading DOGE, or the Department of Government Efficiency.\nDOGE\nis charged with dumping federally-owned real estate as part of its nationwide purge of government assets, employees and programs.\nFound guilty of second-degree murder in 1967 and sentenced to 20 years in prison, King was released from prison three years later when his conviction was reduced to manslaughter. He rose to boxing prominence promoting and arranging some of the sport’s most famous fights featuring the late Muhammad Ali, considered the greatest boxing champion of all time. King also managed and promoted George Foreman, Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield and Roy Jones Jr., among other world champs.\nA longtime Palm Beach County resident, King owns a former\nJai Alai fronton\nin Mangonia Park that he tried to sell in the mid-2010s to a potential buyer that proposed redeveloping the site into a mixed-use project featuring a sports facility, retail stores, restaurants, a hotel and vocational and charter schools.

The seller is Hudson Pacific Properties, based in Los Angeles.\nThe real estate investment trust listed the 119-year-old brick and timber building last year, seeking between $200 and $250 per square foot, or between $27.7 million and $34.6 million.\nFinancial terms of the pending deal between Frontline and Hudson Pacific were not disclosed. But a source told the Business Times a Frontline purchase would “track” near the listed price.\nHudson Pacific bought the building in 2011 for $56.4 million, or $408 per square foot.\nThe Class A building, built in 1906 and renovated in 1999, has exposed timber beams and brick walls, and has the original arched brick doorways and metal sliding fire doors, according to KBS.\nThe building is now 38.7 percent leased, or more than 60 percent vacant.\n\nA deal would mark the second purchase for Frontline this year. In January, the firm snapped up an 91,000-square foot building in a lender sale at 1440 Broadway in downtown Oakland for\n$5.5 million, or $60 per square foot\n, 86 percent less than its previous sale.\nFrontline founder Rob Mann described 1440 Broadway as the type of building he wanted to acquire more of: a well-located asset “with significant potential to create value through thoughtful repositioning and patience.”\nFrontline Realty Capital, founded in 2016, invests in industrial, retail and office properties in the Bay Area, Inland Empire and select western markets, according to its website.\nHudson Pacific Properties, founded in 2009 by Victor Coleman, owns 2.4 million square feet of property in San Francisco, after a buying spree in the early 2010s, according to a regulatory filing. It’s selling\nfour office buildings for up to $150 million\nas it struggles with hundreds of millions in financial losses.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Green Brick owns five subsidiary homebuilders in Texas, including CB JENI Homes, Normandy Homes, Southgate Homes and a 90 percent interest in Centre Living Homes, according to its website.\n\nThe acquisition follows Green Brick’s September purchase of 557 acres along FM 1385 in northern Denton County, where it plans to build 2,200 homes near Pilot Point. The company cited the extension of the Dallas North Tollway to G.A. Moore Parkway as a factor in the area’s growing appeal to homebuyers.\nPrices are expected to start below $400,000. In February, the median home price in Denton County was about $480,000, in Cooke County it was $400,000 and in Grayson County it was $350,000, according to Realtor.com.\nFrom mid-2020 to mid-2023, the population in Denton County jumped 11.2 percent, increased 5.1 percent in Cooke County and 8.4 percent in Grayson County, census data shows.\nDenton County’s population surpassed 1 million in 2023, with nearly 30,000 new residents in a single year.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "A prominent real estate developer may be preparing to enter the race to be the next mayor of Boston.\nThomas O’Brien, managing partner of HYM Investment Group, is weighing a bid to supplant Michelle Wu at the top of the city’s political ranks, the Boston Globe\nreported\n. O’Brien has not officially announced a campaign for the election, which will take place in November.\nO’Brien would likely run as a Democrat. The top two vote-getters for mayor in preliminary voting in September would battle in a runoff two months later.\n“It is clear some developers are willing to do whatever it takes to buy this office,” read a statement from the Wu reelection campaign.“It seems like Josh Kraft is not turning out to be what they expected and now they are shopping for a new option.”\nResidents and business leaders have called O’Brien to express concern about fiscal health, rising property taxes, affordable housing and the quality of the city’s public school system. The commercial real estate community has lately grown frustrated with Wu, particularly her attempts to\nraise commercial property tax rates\nwhile capping rent hikes for residences.\nO’Brien has a number of important real estate developments in the works with HYM. The firm is spearheading the redevelopment of Suffolk Downs and the Government Center Garage. The firm also won the bid to develop a parcel in Roxbury into a life sciences hub and housing.\n\nProminent projects for HYM, which launched in 2009, also include Boston Landing in Brighton, NorthPoint in Cambridge and Bulfinch Crossing in downtown Boston.\nO’Brien — brother of Boston College football coach Bill O’Brien — served the city for five years at the city planning and development agency under Thomas Menino in the 1990s. He resigned after a scandal erupted over a senior agency aide buying a subsidized condo intended for low-income families.\nAnother candidate with a football connection, Josh Kraft — son of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft —\nlaunched his campaign\nlast month. The philanthropist is honing in on rent control and more affordable housing while distancing from his father’s ties to Donald Trump.\nWu will be difficult to beat in the fall, as no incumbent mayor in the city has lost a re-election campaign in more than 75 years.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "Multifamily developers have discovered the Las Vegas Arts District, which went from housing used clothing and furniture stores to a hip hot spot for restaurants and shops.\nNashville-based Southern Land is building a 337-unit apartment complex at 1200 South 3rd Street,\nthe Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.\nAt the same time, Chicago-based Cedar Street Companies and Salt Lake City-based Bridge Investment Group are constructing a 311-unit apartment complex at 123 West Imperial Avenue.\nA dozen years ago, the Arts District was dead, with a smattering of furniture stores, second-hand clothing shops and vacant storefronts, empty lots and little foot traffic.\n“It just seemed like a completely dormant neighborhood,” Josh Molina, who opened a Makers &amp; Finders restaurant and coffee bar in 2014, told the newspaper. Even “desolate.”\nThen came a\nflood\nof new restaurants, coffee shops and stores, filling the streets with people.\nWith increased popularity, landlords also have boosted rents.\nSouthern Land’s project site\nused to be mostly vacant land, with a shuttered commercial building that had broken windows, graffiti and homeless sleepers.\nThe company is now building three seven-story buildings there with a two-story fitness center, a rooftop deck and 8,600 square feet of ground-floor shops and restaurants. The firm expects to open early next year, according to Southern Land development manager Alex Woodin.\n\nWoodin said his firm began looking at the Arts District four years ago, noting its walkability.\n“It felt good, it felt right,” he told the Review-Journal.\nCedar Street Companies and Bridge Investment Group have also broken ground, and have said they expect to open by next summer. The seven-story complex will include a large fitness center, a resort-style spa, including saunas, and ground-floor shops and restaurants.\nSouthern Land, founded in 1986 by Tim Downey, has built apartments and homes from New York to Nevada, according to its website.\nCedar Street Companies, founded in 2009 by Alex Samoylovich, Will Murphy and Mark Heffron, has $4 billion in assets under management, including 7,500 apartments across numerous markets, including Chicago, San Diego, Portland, Minneapolis and Cleveland, according to a release.\nBridge Investment Group, an alternative investment firm founded in 2009, had $49.4 billion of assets under management as of September 2023. The firm went public in 2021.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Jackson-Shaw Chairman Lewis W. Shaw, who built a small Dallas firm into a real estate development titan, has died. He was 82.\nShaw was raised in Dayton, Ohio, and graduated from Wittenberg University in Springfield before serving in the United States Air Force, where he was a cryptologist and flight instructor. He arrived in Dallas to work for IBM in 1974.\n“I’d always wanted to be a Texan,” he told the Dallas Morning News in 2004. His father was an orphan, raised in the Buckner Children’s Home in Dallas, and was killed at a railroad crossing when Shaw was 4. As a child, Shaw spent summers with an uncle in Aransas Pass.\nShaw met Jim Jackson at Addison Airport when Jackson asked Shaw to give him aerobatic lessons, and Jackson hired Shaw as a salesman at his four-person real estate firm Jackson Companies. Shaw took over the company after Jackson died in a plane crash in 1976 and renamed it two years later.\nUnder Shaw’s leadership, Jackson-Shaw developed more than 63 million square feet of industrial and hospitality real estate nationwide, including hotels in Las Vegas, Phoenix and Fort Worth, as well as nondescript low-rise office and industrial buildings tucked into major cities.\nHe was known for financing his own projects and hanging onto assets the firm developed rather than selling them off.\n“I don’t build with somebody else’s MasterCard,” Shaw told the Dallas Morning News in 2004. “My first priority is who will pay the rent, not who will buy the project. It’s cash flow, not cashing out.”\nPart of his development strategy for light industrial development was to find land that nobody wanted.\n\n“I don’t want to join the crowd. I want to get there before it assembles. Proof of low demand for me is proof of opportunity,” he said in 2004.\nShaw co-founded American General Hospitality in 1980. Its portfolio fell into distress after the global stock markets crash of 1987, and lenders took nine of its properties, but Shaw continued to manage them.\nThe hospitality company became a publicly traded REIT in 1996 and later merged with Meristar REIT and Interstate Hotels &amp; Resorts.\nShaw was known as a reader and a music lover who had a casual style of dressing and a contrarian spirit.\n“Lewis is a lone wolf avoiding the herd mentality yet fiercely loyal to his friends and partners,” NAI Global Chairman Tom Lynn said in 2004.\nA list of survivors wasn’t immediately available.\nShaw was inducted into the North Texas Commercial Association of Realtors Hall of Fame in 2003. He also served on the Wittenberg University Board of Directors and was actively involved in numerous civic and national organizations. A dedicated aviator, he had a lifelong passion for flying and traveled extensively in his own aircraft.\n",

    "content": "A man who authorities say played a key role in a multimillion-dollar\nmortgage fraud\nscheme in Florida was arraigned on Tuesday morning after he was extradited to the U.S. from Nigeria.\nOkechukwu Josiah Odunna, a resident of Abuja, Nigeria, was charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution, for his alleged role in an $8 million plot that involved 20 residential properties in Florida, including homes in Miami Shores and North Miami Beach, court records show. Each count carries up to a 30-year prison sentence. Others involved included former North Miami Mayor\nMarie Lucie Tondreau\n.\nBetween 2005 and 2008, Odunna, then a licensed attorney, and his co-conspirators allegedly submitted fraudulent loan applications to banks and other financial institutions that resulted in lenders handing out more money than they otherwise would, according to the United States Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of Florida. The applications included fake names of borrowers, inflated sale prices and false information about the funds.\n\nOdunna was a settlement agent in about 20 allegedly fraudulent closings. The properties included the homes at 9906 North Miami Avenue in\nMiami Shores\n, 216 Northwest 100th Street in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, and 16325 Northeast Sixth Avenue in\nNorth Miami Beach\n, according to the indictment.\nThe indictment was filed in 2014, but Odunna was only arrested a decade later, in September of last year, by Nigerian authorities. He was transported to the U.S. last week and had his first appearance before a judge on March 6.\nThe alleged scheme also involved Karl Oreste, Tondreau and Kelly Augustin. Oreste was sentenced to more than eight years in prison, but granted a compassionate release in 2020. He owes over $8 million in restitution. Tondreau, the former mayor, was convicted by a jury trial in late 2014 and sentenced to more than five years in prison. She recruited straw buyers for the deals alongside Agustin, according to the indictment. Augustin is still a fugitive.\n",

    "content": "Multifamily landlords have the upper hand over Chicago renters, and that’s not likely to change for years as apartment leasing prices are set to soar amid a cliffdrop for development.\nThe city’s downtown apartment market reached new heights last year, when the average unit within a group of 84 buildings tracked by Luxury Living surpassed $3,000 for the first time ever, according to the multifamily brokerage and consultant. The mean figure landed at $3,077, up 28 percent from 2023, with units in the Streeterville neighborhood — which holds the largest average floorplans of downtown areas — commanding the most-expensive average rent at $3,648.\nLandlords and their leasing teams pushed prices to the new milestone despite smaller units — studios and convertibles, in particular — making up a larger share of deals last year, Luxury Living found.\n“Knowing how minimal the new supply pipeline is, it’s easy to see demand will continue to go up. Retention will be high,” said Aaron Galvin, Luxury Living’s founder and a developer of the Saint Grand, a 248-unit tower in Streeterville that was being leased last year after opening to residents.\nLease signings increased 33 percent last year within the buildings studied, up to 14,086 from 10,600 in 2023. But there’s little carryover of new, move-in ready units into this year. In fact, only about 500 units are expected to come online this year, down from the 10-year average of more than 3,500 units, according to Integra Realty Resources. Historically low vacancy rates are the anticipated result.\n“Rents are expected to spike in 2025,” Integra said in its outlook.\nThe next two years aren’t so promising for renters, either, as developers are constrained by tight capital markets, rising construction costs and, most recently, increased uncertainty over material costs as President Trump threatens major trading partners with tariffs.\n\n“Developers indicate virtually every deal remains in a holding pattern until at least mid-2025,” Integra said, noting that the next wave of deliveries won’t occur until 2027 at the earliest.\nBehind Streeterville, the next-priciest downtown Chicago submarkets are River North, Gold Coast/Old Town and the West Loop/Fulton Market, which are the only others with average unit rents in excess of $3,000. The Loop was the only neighborhood where renters might have caught a break last year, with the average lease signed decreasing slightly to $2,848, down from $2,872 in 2023, Luxury Living found. The South Loop and River West respectively trailed those neighborhoods.\nFurthermore, the average unit size stayed fairly flat last year, at 781 square feet, up from 777 in 2023, but tenants opted far more often for studio and convertible units, forsaking the extra space offered by one-bedroom layouts in exchange for a break on cost, Galvin said. Rents per square foot were up 2.1 percent to $3.94 last year.\n“That’s coming down to attainability in terms of income that we’re seeing in the market,” Galvin said. ​​”There are just that many more people making enough money to qualify for studios and convertibles, as compared to one-beds.”\nRenters of smaller units are also less likely to need parking, he said, which developers are noting as they plot their return to the market from the slowdown.\n“When you’re looking at construction costs and how to get the development pipeline turned on again, less parking is likely to be more of a trend moving forward,” Galvin said.\nEditor’s note: This story was updated to correct the rents per square foot figure.\n",

    "content": "Homebuilders are prepping for an industry doomsday: President Donald Trump’s tariffs.\nBuilders and contractors across the country told the Wall Street Journal they were accumulating materials or altering construction plans as the administration’s plan to tax imports takes shape, spelling concerns for heightened home prices\nSome contractors are paying out of pocket to acquire lumber, steel and other materials before Trump’s tariffs are implemented. In addition to the money needed upfront to acquire the surplus of goods, builders also need to pay for places to store the excess materials.\nWhile Trump aired tariffs ahead of his election victory in November, his broadside promises have grown more uncertain in recent weeks.\n“I can’t keep ping ponging back and forth,” Idaho-based Steve Martinez told the Journal after Trump’s latest pause on select tariffs implemented against Canada and Mexico.\nLumber is among the items affected; more than 70 percent of imported softwood lumber comes from the two countries, according to the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nTariffs aren’t the only challenge facing builders under Trump. Contractors are also facing the potential loss of immigrant labor due to the administration’s hardline stance on illegal immigration and steady stream of deportation threats.\nIf or when the tariffs do land, the extra costs will likely result in ballooning home prices. The NAHB estimates the costs of building a single-family home could increase by $7,500 to $10,000.\nBuilders anticipated the tough times ahead under Trump’s second term, with reports of stockpiling materials surfacing\nshortly after the election\n. But a drop in consumer demand for new homes could leave builders paying to store materials they can’t use.\nOther builders are exploring materials that can be sourced in the United States, constructing smaller homes or taking a stab at modular construction. Builders are also pursuing incentives to reel in buyers, such as mortgage buydowns and cash discounts.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "Austin’s high-end condo market got a jolt last week, with two condos over $2 million going under contract and six more landing on the market.\nTwelve homes listed for over $2 million went under contract last week in Austin, along with 10 single-family homes and two condos, according to the Eklund Gomes luxury report.\nOne of the condos, at the Austonian, was listed for $2.3 million, and the other for $2.2 million at an eight-townhome complex at 706 West Avenue.\nUnit 38SW at the Austonian, at 200 Congress Ave, spans 1,800 square feet, asking about $1,290 per square foot. It has two bedrooms and a study and comes with two parking spaces, a storage unit and electric car charger. Betty Epperson of Epperson Realty Group had the listing.\nUnit H at 706 West Avenue in downtown was recently renovated and has three bedrooms. It spans 2,200 square feet, asking $1,000 per square foot, with a private two-car garage. Moreland Properties agent Monica Painter had the listing.\nThe highest-priced active condo listing came online on March 10, asking $4.25 million, unit at The Colorfield at 1006 Baylor Street. Unit 303 is one of 10 residences in the building, spanning almost 3,000 square feet with three bedrooms. Unit 202 also hit the market the same day asking for $3.75 million. Moreland Properties is selling all units at the development.\nAustin developer Cumby Group will open its four-story The Colorfield development this summer, according to its website. Its penthouse unit is listed for $9 million.\n\nThe majority of the single-family homes under contract were centered around Tarrytown and West Lake Hills, with a few exceptions.\nLast listed at $3.8 million, the top contract was signed for a home at 16001 Pontevedra Place in the Barton Creek Bluffs neighborhood in Bee Cave. It spans 6,000 square feet on 1 acre, asking about $630 per square foot, with two stories and six bedrooms plus a media room, two game rooms, a pool and sports court. Thomas Stone from Stone Properties has the listing.\nAlso outside the usual high-end neighborhoods where multi-million dollar homes sell, the lowest-priced deal of the bunch was for a $2.4 million new home near Bear Creek, listed by Clay Lake of Keeping It Realty. It spans 4,260 square feet on over 2 acres, asking about $565 per square foot.\nThe second priciest deal was for a home asking $3.3 million in Tarrytown. At 3600 Taylors Drive, the four bedroom, 3,000-square-foot home comes with an office and a pool on a third of an acre. It asked for about $1,085 per square foot and was listed by Megan DeLeeuw Cavazos of Gottesman Residential Real Estate.\nMore contracts were signed last week than\nthe week before\n, from 10 to 12, but total sales volume dropped $2.3 million to $34.1 million.\nThe single-family homes had an average of $721 per square foot and their average days on market increased slightly to 68 from 63 days, the report said. The two condos had an average of $1,144 per square foot and 185 days on market.\n",

Last week, they sold the property for $60 million.\nThe Curnins sold the 9,640-square-foot home at 66 La Gorce Circle to a land trust named after the address, records show. The 0.4-acre property faces north, overlooking Normandy Isle.\n“Brokers were obviously constantly reaching out. It was never really intended to be for sale,” said James Curnin, founder and CEO of\nClara Homes\n, calling it a “really tough decision” to sell the house. It was completed in late August and his family had moved in by September.\nMax Strang designed the house, and New York-based Pembroke &amp; Ives handled the interior design and furnishings. The property was sold in an off-market deal that included most of the furniture, Curnin said. He declined to identify the buyer.\nJordan Karp brokered the sale.\nClara Homes\npaid $7.5 million\nfor the property in 2020 and had the previous house demolished, records show. It was later transferred into the Curnins’ names.\n\nOn the\nsame island\n, consumer goods multimillionaire Anand Khubani\npaid $100 million\nin September for the properties at 18, 22 and 24 La Gorce Circle, where he plans a massive estate.\nLast year, Curnin’s Clara Homes sold an unfinished waterfront spec house on the Venetian Islands to Long Light Capital’s Justin Korsant for $23.1 million. Clara Homes also has projects in Miami’s Wynwood and Bay Harbor Islands.\nThe Curnins’ most recent sale on La Gorce Island adds to a string of recent big-ticket deals in Miami Beach and across South Florida.\nLate last month, billionaire developer\nVlad Doronin\nsold his waterfront Star Island estate for $120 million, setting a new record for home sales in Miami-Dade County. Doronin’s Garden Islands International LLC sold the 2.5-acre property at 26 Star Island Drive in Miami Beach to Constellation Drive LLC, a Delaware entity led by businessman Michael Ferro.\nAbout the same time, gaming entrepreneur Richard Skelhorn\npaid $45 million\nfor the waterfront mansion at 40 Palm Avenue in Miami Beach, setting a record for Palm Island.\n",

    "content": "Greenpoint Landing seems to be expanding.\nPark Tower Group filed plans for three additional buildings in the Brooklyn community, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The three parcels are within the 22-acre riverfront development in Greenpoint.\nThe listed owner in all three building applications was Park Tower Group chief operating officer Anne Carson Blair. The building filings were first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\nThe largest of the three filings was at 21 Freeman Street. Gary Handel of Handel Architects submitted a plan for a 40-story, 400,000-square-foot building with 503 residential units. Handel also filed plans for a 30-story, 220,000-square-foot building with 298 units at 37 Freeman Street and for a nine-story, 172,000-square-foot building with 224 units at 209 West Street.\nCombined, the properties comprise 1,025 additional housing units for Greenpoint Landing across nearly 800,000 square feet. Park Tower declined to comment to the Observer.\n\nThe 11-building, 5,500-unit master-planned Greenpoint Landing — situated near where the East River meets Newton Creek — has been in the works for decades; the first phase of construction commenced in 2014. The project includes 1,400 affordable housing units and five acres of open space for the public.\nThe most recent addition to Greenpoint Landing came at 16 Dupont Street, a 41-story tower developed alongside Rockefeller Group that opened last year. The partners secured\na $200 million construction loan\nfrom Japan-based Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank to finance the project in 2022.\nBrookfield Properties is also a partner on numerous buildings within Greenpoint Landing. Most of the residential properties in Greenpoint Landing are rentals, though condominiums are becoming\nincreasingly attractive\nin the Brooklyn neighborhood.\nElsewhere in Greenpoint, logistics company Prologis started the year by acquiring the 10-acre site at 440 Kingsland Avenue from ExxonMobil\nfor $122 million\n. A logistics facility or vehicle storage hub are among the possibilities raised for the parcel.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The total contract volume was $80.8 million.\nDuring the same week last year, there were 16 contracts signed for $50 million.\nThe priciest deal last week belonged to 297 Pacific Street in Boerum Hill, which last asked $8.5 million.\nThe 25-foot-wide carriage house initially hit the market at the start of last year, asking $12 million before dropping the price almost 30 percent in June.\nThe nearly 5,700-square-foot home has five bedrooms, four bathrooms and private parking. The four-story house has two wings that flank a 920-square-foot Great Room on the first floor with a 20-foot overhead skylight and stone wood-burning fireplace.\nThe second floor has a private terrace, while the third floor has a primary suite with two walk-in closets and access to a private fourth-floor study and terrace.\n\nCorcoran’s Lesley Semmelhack had the listing.\nThe second most expensive contract was a single-family home at 1135 84th Street in Dyker Heights asking $4.3 million.\nSpanning over 5,000 interior square feet, the first floor of the seven-bedroom manse has ceilings over 10 feet high and custom wood molding and trimmings, seven wood-burning fireplaces and stained glass windows, as well as a den that leads out onto a front porch.\nThe property sits on an 8,000-square-foot lot, also home to a detached two-car garage.\nDanielle Jabour of Jabour Realty Company had the listing.\nIt was the third straight week that contract numbers have trended up in the Brooklyn luxury market — three weeks ago there were 16 contracts signed for $43.3 million in asking volume, and two weeks ago 25 contracts signed for $75.7 million.\nThe average price per square foot in the most recent period was $1,471 and the average discount was 3 percent.\n",

    "content": "The Pérez family’s Related Group proposes a 390-unit Live Local Act project for the second phase of its redevelopment of a South Miami public housing complex.\nThe application comes as the Coconut Grove-based firm has seized on the state law that incentivizes development of apartments at affordable and workforce rents, with a flurry of new proposals.\nRelated wants to build an 11-story building with 8,700 square feet of retail and 501 parking spaces on a 3.3-acre site at 5949 Southwest 68th Street, according to the company’s application filed to Miami-Dade County last week. The project, called Gallery at SoMi Parc, would consist of one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments.\nRelated is asking the county for a pre-application meeting to discuss building the project under the Live Local Act and Miami-Dade’s Rapid Transit System-Development Zone — SMART Corridor Subzone, a regulation that gives wiggle room for development due to a site’s proximity to a public transportation station or major road. Pre-application meetings are generally requested before a developer files an official proposal.\nGallery at SoMi Parc marks the second phase of Related’s redevelopment of a 6.2-acre county-owned site that was home to South Miami Gardens Apartments public housing complex. The project’s first phase is the 172-unit Residences at SoMi Parc mixed-income building that opened last year at 5961 Southwest 68th Street, adjacent to the Gallery at SoMi Parc development site.\nIn 2020, Miami-Dade sought a request for proposals to redevelop the 58-unit South Miami Gardens Apartments complex and selected Related’s affordable housing arm, Related Urban Development Group, later that year, according to a 2022 county commission meeting agenda item when the development agreement was approved. Under the agreement, 58 units at Residences at SoMi Parc replaced the 58 public housing units lost in the South Miami Gardens Apartments redevelopment.\n\nRelated Urban signed a 75-year ground lease with the county for the Residences at SoMi Parc in 2022, according to records. It is expected that Related Urban will sign a similar ground lease for the Gallery at SoMi Parc site after securing project financing, the 2022 agenda item says. The county will receive a total of $101.7 million in payments over the term of the development agreement.\nRelated\n–– led by patriarch\nJorge Pérez\nand his sons Jon Paul and Nicholas Pérez –– has ramped up its development pipeline. The firm for years partnered with the county to redevelop public housing, and in recent months has seized on\nLive Local Act\nfor some of these projects.\nUnder the state law, approved in 2023, developers can build bigger projects than a site’s zoning allows, as long as at least 40 percent of apartments are for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income. The law also provides tax breaks and a reprieve on floor area ratio and parking requirements.\nIn Miami’s Little Havana, Related wants to supersize the 1,379-unit Haley Sofge public housing complex with a\n1,038-unit Live Local Act project\nin a pair of 21-story towers and a 12-story building. The site is at  800 Northwest 13th Avenue, 780 Northwest 13th Court and 1389 Northwest Seventh Street.\nIn Miami’s Health District, Related wants to replace the Claude Pepper age-restricted public housing building with a\n398-unit Live Local project\nwhere all units will be at below-market rents. The site is at 750 Northwest 18th Terrace.\nThis month, Related, New York-based LeFrak Organization and Coconut Grove-based 13th Floor Investments purchased a 2.5-acre development site 3650 Bird Road in Miami for\n$35 million\n. The property has approvals for two 40-story towers with 748 apartments and 20,000 square feet of retail.",

The impact fees are meant to help districts fund expansions and improvements to accommodate the growth.\nNegotiations stalled over a massive gap in expectations. Fremont School District 79 is seeking $50 million from Wirtz to help fund a new $150 million elementary school, while Wirtz’s legal team has countered with an estimate closer to $5 million.\nIn recent weeks, tensions have spilled into the public. School officials accused the village of sidelining them during negotiations and criticized Wirtz for underestimating the project’s potential strain on schools.\nMundelein Mayor Steve Lentz responded by accusing the districts of trying to “embarrass” the high-profile Wirtz family into paying more than what Illinois law requires. Lentz also emphasized that municipalities, not school districts, are responsible for negotiating impact fees.\n",

    "content": "Related California plans to build a 41-story office building and hotel in San Francisco while nearly two out of five city workplaces sit empty.\nFor the Irvine-based developer, it’s all in how you crunch the numbers for the proposed office-hotel tower at 530 Sansome Street, in the North Financial District across from the Transamerica Pyramid near Jackson Square,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nYes, overall office vacancy across the city hovers at a dismal 37 percent.  Yes, the top five buildings have a 16 percent vacancy.\nBut when you pull away the drapes, the city’s true office trophies with views from the Golden Gate to the Bay Bridge command a vacancy of 6.9 percent — the target for the Related venture.\n“Right building in the right location at the right time,” Matt Witte, executive vice president of acquisitions and development for Related California, told the Chronicle.\n“This started out as a contrarian bet but as we dug in deeper and looked at the market, how it is evolving and maturing out of COVID, it doesn’t seem so contrarian any more,” added Gino Canori, president of Related California. “It’s a story about San Francisco’s recovery, about the city coming out of a tough time and building something everyone can be proud of.”\nPlans call for a 544-foot tower with 360,000 square feet of offices atop a five-star, 200-room hotel, plus a new firehouse at 447 Battery Street to replace a station swallowed up by the project. A previous 19-story hotel and fitness club project, approved in 2021, stalled.\nThe city is expected to publish an environmental study on Tuesday, March 11. Related hopes to secure approvals to build the tower this fall, allowing the firm to break ground by late next year. If all goes well, the gleaming glass rectangle could be completed by 2030.\nIt would be the first new North Financial District building since 350 Bush Street opened in 2018, and the first new five-star hotel in 30 years, according to the Chronicle. It’s expected to cost\n$600 million\n.\n\nThe tower, designed by Chicago-based SOM, would anchor a block across from the Transamerica Pyramid, which New York-based Michael Shvo revamped, investing $1 billion. Rents for top-floor offices in the area are north of $200 a square foot, more than three times the city average.\nIt would also be built next to Jackson Square — the hot spot in San Francisco’s glacial rebound.\nRelated California, a unit of New York-based Related Companies, “did a lot of homework,” touring buildings and digging into leasing data, Canori said.\nAs it hoovered up information, it grew convinced there was demand for a new building with “killer views” and features that top tenants want  — meeting rooms and workout facilities and outside terraces and swank restaurants.\nSuch amenities not only help recruit and retain talent. They attract them to a return-to-office.\nThree North Financial District tenants have leases expiring in 2030 who are “taking a very close look” at the proposed building, Canori told the newspaper, which “is further emboldening our ability to press ahead with getting the project approved and started.\n“We think the market is there,” he declared.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

It’s looking to expand its reach into affordable housing.\nDon Mullen’s investment manager is\nraising money\nearmarked for acquiring single-family homes that can be rented affordably, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. It would be the first time Pretium is raising a fund for the category.\nThe $60 billion asset manager plans to acquire properties, renovate them extensively and rent them out to those with Section 8 housing vouchers. The program subsidizes rents for those earning 50 percent or less of the area median income.\nMore than 2.3 million households are in the federal program; Pretium rents to 2,500 households with vouchers already, according to its website.\nThe company declined the outlet’s request for comment on its plan.\nPretium’s motivation could have something to do with elevated borrowing costs. The company reportedly sees an opportunity to acquire properties at prices that could deliver better yields than what it may earn at higher price points.\n\nWhile Pretium owns and manages nearly 100,000 single-family rentals, the traditional aspects of the business are not what they once were a few years ago. When interest rates that cratered at the beginning of the pandemic skyrocketed, it became more challenging to purchase homes and garner sufficient rent to cover mortgage payments.\nPretium’s most recent newsworthy acquisition came almost two years ago, when it bought\n$1.5 billion\nworth of homes from D.R. Horton, 4,000 properties largely in the Southeast and Southwest parts of the country.\nThe Section 8 program is\nfacing its own set of issues\nas Donald Trump’s administration rattles the federal government. Layoffs, funding shortfalls and regulations are threatening the nation’s largest rental assistance initiative for low-income families.\nA budget proposed by the House of Representatives could result in approximately 283,000 households losing voucher access in what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities called “the most severe funding shortfall in the history of the voucher program.”\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "The Canero Group is planning a 54-unit townhouse project in Homestead, aiming to appeal to Miami locals priced out by the area’s luxury boom.\nThe Coral Gables-based firm scored Miami-Dade County’s approval for a total of 66 townhouses for the 2.7-acre site at 27800 Old Dixie Highway, but decided against using the total allotment, President Jose A. Canero confirmed. The units will each span 1,900 square feet with three bedrooms, and prices will start at $500,000, he said.\nCanero said his target demographic is local buyers getting priced out of the Miami area’s urban centers. Edward Silva of Miami-based E.S.A. Architects is designing the townhomes. Construction is expected to begin early next year, Canero said.\n\nThe firm dropped $537,500 on the\nHomestead\ndevelopment site in 2023, property records show. Holland &amp; Knight attorneys Juan Mayol and Oliver Wechsler represented Canero in the approval process.\nCanero’s townhomes are the latest in a stacked pipeline of planned residential developments in south Miami-Dade County. The firm also has\na 223-unit rental building\nin the works at 24735 South Dixie Highway in Princeton.\nNearby in Homestead, Lennar proposed\n119 single-family homes\non 58 acres in January.

He described himself in an interview with Business Insider as “very much an operator” compared to Lorber, who “was not an operational person at all.”\nThough Elliman fell further into the red, the company managed to up its revenue to nearly $1 billion in 2024, up from the $960 million it reported the year prior.\n“We are building momentum,” Liebowitz said on the call. “Our agents and employees are energized as we lead Douglas Elliman into a new era.”\nElliman continued to slash spending last year, continuing a cost-cutting campaign it ramped up in 2023 after rising mortgage rates and low inventory stalled the housing market. The firm reduced its expenses by roughly $20 million in 2024.\n“The management team remains focused on Douglas Elliman’s transformation,” chief financial officer Bryant Kirkland said on the call.\nHe added that the company’s “core operations” were starting to reap the benefits of cost cutting, as well as investments in its development marketing business. Kirkland said the firm’s new development pipeline is worth $28 billion, with about $18 billion in Florida alone. He expects about $5 billion in new development to come to market by March 2026.\nElliman has been on a quarterly losing streak for the past two years, but the firm narrowed the gap in the fourth quarter. It reported a net loss of $6 million, compared to $15 million in the same period in 2023.\nThe company reported an operating loss of $16 million, less than the $24 million it lost a year ago.\n\nThe firm also reported $243 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, up from $214 million in 2023. Elliman finished the year with $145 million in cash and investment securities.\nA turbulent 2025\nThe end of the year was a turbulent one for the residential giant. The company upended its leadership at the end of last year, and Liebowitz, a board member, took the reins.\nThe shakeup began when Lorber abruptly resigned from his post in October under pressure from the board.\nHis departure followed an internal investigation into the company’s culture, after sexual assault allegations surfaced against two of its former top brokers, Tal and Oren Alexander. During the investigation, Lorber\nadmitted to having\nintimate relationships with two of the firm’s agents, Bloomberg reported.\nBoth Lorber and Elliman were\nnamed as defendants\nin one of the latest lawsuits filed against the Alexanders and their brother Alon, who were arrested on federal sex trafficking charges in December. The complaint accuses the firm and its former executive of knowing about the brothers’ alleged behavior and enabling it during their time as agents.\nDays after Lorber’s exit, Elliman\nterminated Scott Durkin\n, the CEO of its brokerage segment. The firm tapped Richard Ferrari, the head of its Northeast and New York regions, to take his place. Elliman’s chief operating officer Richard Lampen also\nretired in December\n.\nThe upheaval continued into the start of 2025, when the CEO of firm’s Western region,\nStephen Kotler, resigned\namid multiple lawsuits over alleged kickback schemes involving reality TV stars and one of the company’s escrow businesses. The lawsuits have since been settled, and Kotler is still working with the firm as an agent.\nAlong with Kotler’s departure, the firm also closed two of its offices in California, including one in Malibu and the other in Pasadena. In December, Elliman also\ntook over the lease\nfor an office in Miami’s Design District that once belonged to its former parent company, Vector Group.\nDespite the chaos, Liebowitz ended the call on an optimistic note, touting his faith in the company and improvements on the horizon.\n“When we last spoke in November, I told you I took on the CEO role because I believed in the Douglas Elliman brand,” Liebowitz said. “Our best days are ahead for this company.”\n",

    "content": "While the city continues to experience a surge in demand compared to last year, the new development market has open 2025 relatively flat.\nIn February, New York City notched 240 new development contracts compared to 272 last year, according to Marketproof’s monthly\nreport\n.\nThe numbers for February were somewhat inflated by batch reporting in Queens, but Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group’s Ryan Schleis also pointed to 12 sales at 155 West 68th Street, an old 1980 rental conversion that never released all of its inventory, as a sign that market has stayed afloat this year despite a lack of fresh supply.\n“In Manhattan, there really haven’t been many new launches,” he said. “So that’s one thing that’s holding back the market a little bit, but it’s driving some interest back to some buildings that have been on the market for a while.”\nFebruary counted 402 new listings, down from 720 new listings last February and 793 new listings two years ago.\nExcluding the Lincoln Square conversion, Glacier Equities and InterVest Capital Partners project at 720 West End Avenue led the Manhattan market with eight signed deals last month, according to Marketproof. Units are priced between $1 million and more than $12 million at the Thomas Juul-Hansen designed building.\nBut the 131-unit building, which launched sales last year with Corcoran Sunshine, has also benefited from batch reporting after not posting a contract for all of last year, according to Schleis.\n\nHe pointed to sales at One High Line and 50 West 66th Street — both buildings that launched sales over a year ago — as strong performers that have been steadily selling.\nIn total, Manhattan saw 101 contracts signed compared to 136 last year. The median sale price was $2.7 million, and the median price per square foot was $2,138.\nThe luxury market has continued to buoy new development, especially in Manhattan. There were 37 contracts priced at or above $4 million in February compared to 33 posted last year.\nBuyers signed 92 deals in Brooklyn, down from 109 last year. The median sale price was $1.5 million and the median price per square foot was $1,375.\nAvdoo &amp; Partners Development’s\nBergen Brooklyn development\nled the borough with seven contracts for units asking between $1.5 million and $3.4 million. The 105-unit development has passed the halfway mark in sales since launching last year.\nIn Queens, the Austin in Forest Hills reported 15 contracts which cover the last three months since Modern Spaces launched sales in December. Rybak Development’s 98-unit project has condos ranging from under $1 million to $3.9 million, with an average price per square foot of $1,240, according to Marketproof.\n",

    "content": "Two new long-term retail leases have been signed at Mission Rock, and a long-awaited French bakery has opened its doors in the development.\nBlue Bottle Coffee and Sweetgreen have both signed 10-year leases at the 28-acre Mission Bay development, which is owned by the Port of San Francisco and was formerly a parking lot for the Giants, according to a news release Tuesday from developer Tishman Speyer and the San Francisco Giants.\nThe development team is now wrapping up its first phase with two apartment buildings and two office towers, one of which is Visa’s market support center, which provides resources for the credit card company’s clients and businesses globally.\nOakland-founded Blue Bottle will occupy 2,069 square feet at the base of the Visa building at 300 Toni Stone Crossing. The 13-story tower houses nearly 1,000 Visa employees, according to the company’s website.\nSalad and grain bowl shop Sweetgreen will take just under 2,400 square feet at the base of The Canyon, a residential tower at the intersection of Dr. Maya Angelou Lane and Toni Strone Crossing. A representative for Tishman Speyer said that the developer anticipates both Sweetgreen and Blue Bottle will be submitting their permits shortly. The rep declined to give any further information on tenant improvement allowances or lease terms.\nCBRE’s Alex Sagues and Laura Barr represented Mission Rock Partners. Blue Bottle was represented by Benzi Blatman with CBRE, while Sweetgreen was represented by AJ Schrader with Tier One Retail Group.\nBeloved French bakery Arsicault, known as much for its long lines as its buttery pastries, was announced as a retail tenant in Mission Rock\nin the summer of 2023\nand just opened this week. It is the San Francisco pastry-makers’ third location, after expanding from its original location in the Inner Richmond into Civic Center in 2020. It signed a 10-year lease for nearly 2,500 square feet at the base of the Verde apartment tower in Mission Bay, according to the developers. At least to start, its Mission Rock offerings will be the same as at their other locations.\n\n“Our bakery honors traditional pastry-making techniques while Mission Rock represents San Francisco’s vibrant future,” Arsicault owner Armando Lacayo said in a statement. “The combination feels perfect for this community where tradition and innovation blend together seamlessly.”\nIn a statement, San Francisco Giants vice president of real estate development Julian Pancoast called the arrival of Arsicault, and signing of Blue Bottle and Sweetgreen leases, “exceptional additions” that were “carefully selected” to “enhance our vision of being a welcoming destination for all to enjoy.”\nA Giants representative added that it is important to “curate” a variety of brands and concepts for the neighborhood to hit a wide range of price points and tastes.”\n“Our goal is to create a dynamic retail ecosystem that supports daily residents and office users while making Mission Rock a destination people visit often, for a variety of experiences,” the rep said via email.\nAdditional retailers will continue to be announced on a rolling basis, according to the press release. So far, much like Arsicault, the strategy seems to be to bring in mostly local brands with an avid following, but without a Mission Bay presence.\nIke’s Love &amp; Sandwiches, LuxFit gym and Proper Food all opened there last summer. The second outpost of Potrero Hill’s Quik Dog, a burger restaurant from the owners of renowned Mission cocktail bar Trick Dog, Flour + Water Pizza Shop, and a full-service restaurant from the team behind Che Fico on Divisadero are scheduled to open in the coming months. The new Che Fico restaurant will presumably have more offerings than the Che Fico Pizzeria that opened blocks away at Chase Center’s Thrive City last fall.\nIt’s not the only crossover between the Golden Gate Warriors’ home stadium and Mission Rock. The Warriors confirmed that the team\nwould be taking 71,000 square feet\nin Mission Rock’s Building B. It was the first lease signed in the nearly 300,000-square-foot building, which was\nbuilt as life sciences space\nbefore pivoting back to traditional office space.\n",

The cost: $125 million.\nTo move forward, the county said last week it needed two documents from the would-be buyer: a quit-claim deed and a release related to litigation,\nthe San Francisco Business Times reported\n.\nCounty Supervisor David Haubert\ntold Fox2 KTVU on Friday\nthe documents were received, signaling a big step forward in the sale.\nThe county also expected to get them in time to approve a sale on Tuesday, March 11.\nThe county had asked the entertainment group to hold a $100 million insurance policy to cover unspecified costs after closing. The entertainment group made a counter offer to hold a $30 million policy for the next two years, which the county had yet to accept late last week.\nCity staff were concerned that a paperwork delay could cause investors to pull their funding and kill the redevelopment deal. The entertainment group and Loop Capital, a major Black-owned investment firm based in Chicago, could not be reached by the Business Times for comment.\n\nCounty negotiators said they had expected to have the required paperwork to allow for final approval from supervisors on Tuesday,\naccording to the San Francisco Chronicle\n.\nThe Coliseum complex includes the stadium, the arena, administrative offices and acres of parking. The entertainment group’s proposed\n$5 billion redevelopment\nproject calls for homes, hotels, a convention center, youth amphitheater, restaurants and museums, while retaining the aging stadium.\nIn 2019, the A’s bought the county’s share of the site for $85 million, and were in the process of paying for it when the team left Oakland for Las Vegas.\nIn July, the entertainment group agreed to buy the city’s share of the Coliseum property for\n$105 million\n.\nIn August, the MLB franchise struck a deal with the entertainment group to sell its stake for\n$125 million\n, which required final approval by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Zeckendorf Development and Atlas Capital Group’s luxury project at 80 Clarkson Street in the West Village has been high on anticipation and low on specifics.\nIn October, the developers tapped\nDan Tubb and Amy Williamson\nto lead sales at the building with Zeckendorf Marketing. No official sales launch date has been announced, but sources say sales are expected to quietly launch this month.\nTeasers for the building have popped up on select agents’ social media profiles in recent weeks. Douglas Elliman’s Alexander Boriskin wrote on\nInstagram\nthat “this highly anticipated development is set to sell out before completion and will likely never be publicly listed.”\nBut the clearest details on the development can be found on an offering plan filed last summer, outlining the property’s amenities, along with initial pricing and floor plans for certain units.\nThe plan shows pricing on 22 of the two-tower site’s 113 residential units and four of 18 accessory staff units, which can be purchased by owners of the largest residences in the building. Only 112 residential units will be available for purchase, with one reserved as the resident manager’s unit.\nThe most expensive unit with pricing released is a $63 million five-bedroom condo on the 31st floor of the West Tower. The home comes with six bathrooms, a powder room and terraces off of either side of the living room. The primary suite has a bedroom that opens onto a private loggia, along with two bathrooms, two walk-in closets and a study.\nThe price per square foot comes out to over $9,000 for the 7,000-square-foot home.\nThe cheapest residential unit with pricing released was a $6.755 million two-bedroom in the south tower. The price per square foot for the 1,929 square foot apartment is just over $3,500.\nThe 22 units have a projected sellout of nearly $430 million, a fraction of the building’s total projected sellout now expected to be well closer to $2 billion (prior reporting had pegged the sellout at around $1 billion).\n\nThe four staff units are priced starting at $1.3 million.\nThe plan also includes pricing for 104 storage lockers starting at $60,000, 105 parking spaces for $750,000 each and 48 wine cellars starting at $40,000, including two private cellars, one for $750,000 and one for $1 million.\nCondo owners will also have access to a broad suite of amenities, including a fitness center on the first floor, a pilates center, swimming pool, and hot and cold plunges on the third floor and a cellar-level spa with sauna and steam rooms, according to the plan.\nThe building is also expected to have a squash court, music room, multi-sports simulator, multi-purpose room, winter garden and a private, members-only restaurant.\nSLCE is serving as the architect of record and Cookfox as the design architect.\nLast year, Zeckendorf and Atlas, partnered with the Baupost Group, a\n$1 billion loan\nfrom London-based Cale Street Partners and San Francisco-based Farallon Capital Management. Prior financing for the project included a $322 million loan package from Blackstone.\nThe development site also includes 175 units of affordable housing at 570 Washington Street, which is attached to 80 Clarkson.\nThe developers bought the site for\n$340 million\nfrom Westbrook Partners in 2022.\n",

    "content": "It took over a year, but the\nnonprofit\nthat won a stake in a Signature Bank loan book that\nfew dared to touch\nhas hurled the first pre-foreclosures against rent-stabilized borrowers on that debt.\nAnd the nonprofit venture, Community Stabilization Partners, alleges those borrowers are personally liable for what is owed.\nA dozen foreclosure complaints have hit the courts in 10 days.\nCommunity Preservation Corporation, one of three parties in the venture, said the suits were not its opening strategy for the $6 billion in loans, which were deemed toxic after a 2019 law devalued some of the deals to\nnext to nothing\n.\n“We have actively worked with borrowers to resolve payment delinquencies and bring the loans back into good standing,” said a spokesperson for CSP.\nBut a subset of sponsors has been “unresponsive and uncooperative,” a combination that forced CSP to take defaults to the courts.\nTwo of those groups are among the most notorious alleged profiteers in the rent-regulated space: cutthroat private lender\nMadison Realty Capital\nand\nVed Parkash\n, a frequent flyer on the public advocate’s\nworst landlord\nlist.\nParkash faces four foreclosure actions over $20 million in debt. For Madison, the suit count totals eight, and the defaulted debt is $157 million, court records show.\nA spokesperson for Madison did not comment in time for publication. Parkash could not be reached.\nIt’s no shocker that the so-called slumlord’s head is among the first to roll.\nParkash has an inch-thick playbook for squeezing illegally high rents out of regulated apartments.\nHe’s been accused of ignoring infestations and violations so tenants would move, allowing him to raise rents or yank units from stabilization entirely. When the 2019 rent law closed those loopholes, Parkash got\nmore creative\n, allegedly locking out renters so he could lease units short-term for more money than the law allows.\n\nIn January, a five-alarm fire tore through one of his Bronx buildings and displaced over 250 tenants. Parkash last year sued the city to exit a program that monitors landlords with chronic heat complaints, the publication\nthe City\nreported.\nThe buildings on the line for Parkash are 89-20 161st Street in Queens, 1110 Anderson Avenue in Brooklyn and 2015 Creston Street in the Bronx.\nMadison Realty Capital is a more nuanced case.\nOnce upon a time, the firm was a go-to lender to Raphael Toledano, an owner ultimately\nbarred\nfrom New York real estate after Attorney General Letitia James pegged him for harassing rent-stabilized tenants via coercive buyouts and illegal construction.\nMadison got pulled in by association. James sued the firm for lending Toledano $124 million on an East Village portfolio with the understanding the landlord would aggressively and illegally deregulate units.\nMadison eventually settled, admitting no wrongdoing. But in 2021, it\nended up\nwith that East Village collateral —15 buildings\nhalf-gutted\nby Toledano’s half-baked deregulation plan. Madison paid\n$153 million\nfor the deal in a credit bid after Toledano liquidated the assets.\nThe lender now faces foreclosure on those properties from CSP. The East Village portfolio includes 27 St. Marks Place, 514 East 12th Street and 223 East 5th Street. The seven\nother\nbuildings named in separate complaints are scattered across Manhattan.\nCSP’s decision to personally pursue the borrowers for whatever the properties fail to fetch at auction could signal that the venture has little faith in the portfolios’ value.\nRecent rent-regulated deals have traded hands at major discounts to pre-2019 prices — 60 percent to\n97 percent off\n.\nThat’s if they trade at all.\nMany investors have sworn off the asset class. Distressed deals are typically riddled with violations, rents are effectively capped and expenses keep rising. It’s a recipe for brain damage at best; at worst, financial pain.\nEven when a lender files to foreclose, most will still consider a workout. But if these deals go to the courthouse steps or the auction Zoom room, Madison and Parkash, respectively, could be on the hook for millions.\n",

    "content": "Hundreds of housing units are coming to Inspiration Lane in Brooklyn. Just on that street, more units were permitted last year than in Midtown Manhattan. The same goes for Far Rockaway and Bayswater in Queens.\nAn update to the Department of City Planning’s Housing Database illustrates the pace of housing construction and permitting in the city last year, while\nunderscoring\nthat some areas of the city are barely adding any new housing stock.\nThe database shows 33,974 new homes were completed in 2024, with the most completed in Brooklyn, at 13,732, followed by 8,061 units in Queens.\nLast year saw the most units completed in a single year since 1965, in part because of the frenzy of new building permits issued to developers seeking to\nqualify for 421a before it expired\nin 2022, according to City Planning. That urgency dissipated last year as the city issued permits for 15,626 new housing units, the lowest level recorded since 2012 (though just a hair more than the number of permits issued in 2016).\nThe tools\nshow\n19 community districts produced fewer than 100 homes and 13 netted fewer than 200 units.\nBy the end of 2024, the city had nearly 100,000 new housing units in the pipeline, based on active new building permits. According to City Planning, 80 to 90 percent of permitted projects are completed in four years, but the agency expects “limits on construction sector capacity” and high interest rates to reduce this percentage.\nIn January, Mayor Eric Adams\nannounced plans\nto build 100,000 housing units in Manhattan over the next decade. Part of that goal would be accomplished through rezoning Midtown South to allow for the construction of an estimated 9,700 homes.\nWhat we’re thinking about\n: What real estate-related policies are you expecting to see in the state Senate and Assembly budget resolutions? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we’ve learned\n: Ads featuring Smokey Bear are the longest-running public service announcements in the U.S.,\naccording to NPR\n. The character, a black bear wearing a park ranger hat, has warned Americans for 80 years: “Only you can prevent forest fires.”\n\nElsewhere in New York…\n— Manorville residents may have started the brush fires on Long Island while trying to make s’mores, police say. Investigators believe the blazes may have started in a backyard on North Cozine Road, where a family attempted to use a piece of cardboard to start a fire,\nNBC New York reports\n. The fire in the Westhampton Pines burned through an estimated 600 acres over the weekend. Reports indicate the attempt to make s’mores happened around 9:30 a.m. on Saturday.\n—  City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams officially launched her mayoral campaign on Saturday. Seven City Council members have endorsed her, along with current and former members of the state legislature,\nCity &amp; State reports\n.\n— Meanwhile, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo now has the backing of another union. Leaders of Local-3 IBEW, which represents nearly 29,000 electrical workers, announced that the union is endorsing Cuomo, after endorsing Mayor Eric Adams in 2021,\nthe New York Daily News reports\n.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Monday was\n$18 million\nfor a 5,700-square-foot co-op unit at 88 Central Park West. The Upper West Side unit at The Brentmore was listed by\nCompass’s\nLeonard Steinberg, Herve Senequier, Amy Mendizabal, Calli Sarkesh and Niklas Hackstein.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was a 27,300-square-foot office building at 37-02 82nd Street for\n$11.4 million\n. The Jackson Heights building has 15 units across three stories.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was a condo unit for $20.8 million at 111 West 57th Street. The Billionaires’ Row condo is 3,800 square feet and is listed by\nSotheby’s International Realty\n.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 288,250-square-foot, 30-story building at 37 Freeman Street in Brooklyn. This filing is one of three for developer Park Tower Group and their construction of an 11-building residential development in Greenpoint, per\nCommercial Observer\n.\nThe applicant of record is Gary Handel of Handel Architects.\n— Joseph Jungermann",

    "content": "CrowdStreet’s go-to leader for real estate deals at the crowdfunding platform has left the firm for a new job.\nIan Formigle, who served as CrowdStreet’s chief investment officer, has joined Green Light Development to focus on multifamily acquisitions, he announced on LinkedIn.\nFormigle had announced his decision to leave CrowdStreet three weeks ago on LinkedIn. He said he remains a significant equity holder of CrowdStreet.\nFormigle’s departure came shortly after Nightingale Properties CEO Elie Schwartz pleaded\nguilty\nto one count of wire fraud where Schwartz acknowledged misappropriating $54 million of CrowdStreet investor funds.\nThe investors’ money was supposed to go to a Miami Beach office building and an Atlanta office complex. But Schwartz used most of the funds for other purposes, including a $12 million bet on First Republic stock and options as the bank was collapsing, according to prosecutors. Schwartz faces up to 20 years of prison time.\nCrowdStreet has not been accused of wrongdoing. The firm has claimed it is a victim of Schwartz’s actions. In a post on its website, CrowdStreet said it uncovered the fraud and alerted authorities.\nBut the fiasco led some to question CrowdStreet’s responsibilities as a marketplace. CrowdStreet notably did not require Schwartz to put investors’ funds in an escrow account, giving Schwartz direct control over investor funds.\nLast week, 125 investors filed an arbitration claim seeking to get CrowdStreet to cover $7.2 million in losses in another Nightingale deal in\nChicago\n. The investors allege CrowdStreet failed to spot red flags with Nightingale and Schwartz, according to the claim, which\nBisnow first reported\n. CrowdStreet called the allegations meritless in a statement to Bisnow.\n\nFormigle at CrowdStreet\nFormigle joined CrowdStreet in 2014, one year after the company’s founding, as vice president of investments.\nFormigle served “as the key decision-maker on all the deals that come to the marketplace,” he said in a podcast interview in 2021.\nCrowdStreet sought to provide ordinary investors with opportunities to invest in real estate deals usually reserved for private investors. In 2022, CrowdStreet completed a $43 million raise and was growing rapidly. Formigle played a large role in this growth. By the end 2022, Formigle oversaw the 732 investment offerings, resulting in $3.9 billion raised on the platform, according to CrowdStreet’s website.\nBut while CrowdStreet’s revenue rose to $49 million in 2022, its earnings before interest depreciation and amortization was negative $14.5 million, according to sources familiar with the matter. CrowdStreet projected a negative $5 million EBITDA in 2023, the sources said.\n“As a private company, CrowdStreet does not disclose or comment publicly on its financial performance,” a spokesperson for CrowdStreet said in a statement.\nThe Nightingale scandal erupted in the summer of 2023. An independent trustee held a webinar for investors telling them that most of their money had been misappropriated. The trustee put the entities tied to the CrowdStreet investors’ money into bankruptcy protection in Delaware. Schwartz settled with investors but defaulted on his second payment.\nIn the wake of the scandal, CrowdStreet’s CEO\nTore Steen\nstepped down in July 2023. The company appointed an interim CEO before John Imbriglia\ntook charge\nin July 2024.\n",

The portfolio was tied to a $350 million securitized commercial mortgage.\nThe trust representing loan investors\nforeclosed on Adventus’ metro Atlanta holdings\nin December, along with the company’s Chicago assets. Together, they totaled 2.2 million square feet of space.\nThe deal, facilitated by KeyBank National Association on behalf of a trust, closed on Feb. 28, the latest sign of a\nchurning market under pressure\n.\n\nThe complex is 96 percent occupied, according to a JLL brochure. It includes 701 Barrett Lakes Boulevard and 125, 175 and 225 Townpark Drive Northwest.\nNo major changes are planned for TownPark Commons, RG Real Estate founder and President Ryan Goldstein said, though “small capital improvements” could be made “strategically.”\nThis acquisition follows RG Real Estate’s purchase of the discounted Overlook I office building in Vinings last November. The firm’s strategy aligns with a broader trend of recalibration in Atlanta’s office sector.\nOffice sales in the metro area totaled $1.35 billion last year, up from $589 million in 2023, according to CommercialEdge.\nNearly 23 percent of all securitized debt backed by office properties is delinquent, the seventh highest rate out of the top 25 major metro areas in the country, totaling 166 distressed properties and $2.1 billion in distressed debt, according to\ndata from Trepp\n.\n— Judah Duke\n",

The six-story studio offices would contain floor-to-ceiling windows and broad white eaves, supported by round vertical pillars, according to a rendering.\nPending approvals, Prologis would break ground in 2027 and be completed by 2029.\nPrologis bought the former bus terminal in 2021 for\n$91 million\n. Greyhound has moved its L.A. buses to\nUnion Station Patsaouras Transit Plaza\n.\nThe project is one of three large studio developments in the works along the Alameda corridor in Downtown Los Angeles, following similar projects at\n6th\nand\n8th Streets\n, according to Urbanize.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "A Spanish-style mansion in a gated Laguna Niguel community sold for $16.3 million, marking a new record for the city.\nThe sale of 7 Searidge beats out the city’s previous all-time residential high of $15 million for a two-lot transaction at 6 Inspiration that closed in 2014.\nPhillip Caruso, the lead listing agent and part of Christie’s International Real Estate Southern California, said the best comparable to 7 Searidge may be an off-market deal for a 14,000-square-foot home recorded in the same community of Bear Brand Ranch that traded for $12 million in 2015, but there are no other details beyond that.\nCaruso listed the property with his father, Michael Caruso. Their group\njoined Christie’s International Real Estate Southern California\nlast year.\nThe seller was an out-of-state land developer who the Carusos have counted as a long-time client. The mystery buyer was represented by Pacific Sotheby’s International Realty’s AJ Olson Whitfield.\nPhillip Caruso pointed out 7 Searidge still beats out all records in the city on a price-per-square-foot basis, in which the deal penciled out to $1,993 per square foot. That beats out the city’s former record set in 2014, which equated to $625 per square foot.\n“This is an incredible achievement, especially when considering economies of scale,” Caruso said in an email to\nThe Real Deal\n. “Typically, as homes get larger in size, the price per square foot goes down, and as homes are smaller, price per square foot goes up. To be the highest ever in any size home is a testament to the quality, design, build, style and the marketing of this home.”\n\nHomes penciling out to $2,000 per square foot are typically in\nNewport Beach\nor coastal markets, Caruso pointed out.\nThe home on Searidge was designed by Spectrum Architecture and built by Elevated Building Group, with an interior designed by Laura Brophy of Brophy Interiors.\nIt’s a couple miles from the beach, has six bedrooms, eight bathrooms and totals over 8,000 square feet. Among the home’s highlights are a media room, gym, private courtyard, infinity pool, gardens and outdoor kitchen.\nThe purchase price reflects an increase from the just under $16 million listing price, which Caruso attributed to the city’s proximity to several major retail projects.\nThat includes the recently opened\nRiver Street Marketplace\nin San Juan Capistrano and the in-progress revitalization of Dana Point Harbor, which began about a year ago.\n“These are definitely helping to attract a buyer demographic who appreciates more retail and community lifestyle in their locales,” Caruso said. “I have helped numerous clients purchase homes and move from L.A. [and] Newport Beach to Laguna Niguel. You can achieve more on a purchase [or] lease in terms of size, quality and amenities. More bang for your buck.”\nPrices in the city spiked in January more than 40 percent compared to a year earlier, reaching a median price of $1.7 million, according to the most recent data from Redfin.\n",

    "content": "SummerHill Homes got the nod to replace a historic lodge in Los Gatos with 155 townhomes.\nThe San Ramon-based developer was approved by the Los Gatos Town Council to build the three-story development at 50 Los Gatos-Saratoga Road,\nthe San Jose Spotlight reported\n.\nThe 128-room Los Gatos Lodge, which opened 1958, will be demolished.\nPlans for the project, filed in 2023, call for 155 townhomes across 8.8 acres, of which 26 would be set aside as affordable. Parking would accommodate 330 cars.\nIn January, a typical home in the town south of San Jose sold for $2.5 million, up 39.7 percent from a year earlier,\naccording to Redfin\n. Rob Moore, vice mayor for Los Gatos, said the new townhomes would allow people like him a shot at owning a home.\n“I’m one of the one-third of renters that lives in the town of Los Gatos who, as it currently stands, does not have a pathway to home ownership in this town,” he told the council. “When I see this sort of development where these units are likely to go for less than a single-family home goes for in Los Gatos, I see a place where I could see myself potentially living one day.”\nThe Planning Commission\nunanimously recommended\nthe project’s approval last month. SummerHill applied under SB 330, which fast-tracks approvals for cities that are out of compliance with state-\nmandated housing plans\n.\nThe developer could have invoked the\nbuilder’s remedy\n, a legal loophole in state housing law that allows developers to bypass local zoning rules in cities that haven’t certified their housing element plans, providing they include enough affordable housing, according to the Spotlight.\n\nBut the unit of Calabasas-based Marcus &amp; Millichap didn’t in an effort to work with the town.\nThe town must plan to build 1,993 homes by 2031, 847 of which must be affordable to low-income residents.\nThe developer expects to break ground this year, with model homes expected to be built by summer 2027.\nJohn Hickey, vice president of development at SummerHill, said project amenities will help future residents, as well as the surrounding neighborhood. SummerHill Homes has also built the homes at\nBellaterra @ North 40\n, in Los Gatos.\nSummerHil, founded in 1976, has developed more than 7,000 homes in the Bay Area and Southern California, according to its LinkedIn page.\nLast month, the firm partnered with the Houston-based Hanover Company, which paid\n$78.3 million\nfor a century-old fruit stand and orchard at 2620 Seely Avenue in San Jose, with plans to build more than 1,600 homes.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Alexander Mehran Jr. is the\nthird generation of his family\nto run the Sunset Development Company, the San Ramon-based developer and owner behind the 585-acre Bishop Ranch office park, about an hour east of San Francisco. But even though he grew up in the office development world and has been at Sunset Development since 2009, following a stint in New York at Goldman Sachs, Mehran told\nThe Real Deal\nhe still can’t predict what will happen in the Bay Area’s uncertain office market.\n“I threw a dart at the wall,” he joked, when explaining how he decided which of his family’s office properties should be razed to create 300,000 square feet of retail and entertainment at Bishop Ranch’s CityCenter, which opened in 2018, as well as 8,000 planned new housing units.\n“It’s roughly half of what we had,” he said of the company’s current 8 million square feet of commercial space. “It’s the best stuff. I think that as [we] move forward, more people will want to be here. That’s a complete guess. I have no idea.”\nBut Mehran said he is sure that adding a residential component — including a recently opened 177-unit luxury senior assisted living facility from Belmont Village and 404 for-sale single-family homes and duplexes by SummerHill Homes — will be “accretive” to the rest of the community, even if it also means giving up some long-held control.\n“I know that adding people is going to drive the place forward,” he said. “I know that some people have to be owners, and that’s a scary thing. We’ve only had a handful of owners for 40 years here: Chevron, Toyota, Pac Bell and us.”\nSunset sold land to Chevron and Pacific Bell in the early 1980s only to buy it back as both companies downsized and relocated over the last decade. PacBell, now AT&amp;T, sold its 1.8 million-square-foot former headquarters for $250 million in 2014 and Chevron followed, selling its over 1 million-square-foot headquarters\nfor $175 million in 2022\n.\nToday, both are tenants in the former PacBell space, which is now dubbed Lakeside as it overlooks the man-made Annabel Lake. Since the pandemic, AT&amp;T has listed\nlarge subleases\non the 900,000 square feet they agreed to lease back at Lakeside as part of the sale. The former Chevron HQ is now called The Orchards, and the 92-acre property is working its way through the planning process to\nbecome a mix of office, retail and 2,500 new homes\n.\nThe dramatic downsize from two of Bishop Ranch’s biggest players is indicative of broader market trends, and Mehran said developers and owners need to accept that the time where companies were wowed by full-building opportunities is likely coming to a close. When HR firm Robert Half moved from its own 250,000-square-foot building at Bishop Ranch to 70,000 square feet in Lakeside, that was “a big blow,” he said. But he also wasn’t waiting around for another single company to take its place.\n“Strategically, it’s pretty easy for me to just cut it up and multitenant it,” he said, adding that these days having a completely empty office building isn’t exactly a strong calling card. “If you’re walking around with a customer and you’re like, ‘Oh we’ve got this whole building,’ it’s like, ‘Whoa, these guys are in trouble.’”\n\nSunset has also recently begun turning empty offices into turnkey spec suites, which can have lease terms for as short as one year. Mehran said they have rented quickly even at a $1 per-square-foot premium. He’d rather take the shorter-term lease, but put in finishes he knows many tenants will like, instead of something bespoke for a tenant who eventually moves on.\n“I’ve just seen a lot of customers build things that don’t matter in five years or don’t really provide value,” he said.\nSunset is also transforming other underutilized spaces into amenities like gyms, restaurants and coffee spots. Flourish opened in The Orchards last fall and the cafe-style coworking space has everything from private Zoom rooms to conference and collaboration space, as well as a full coffee bar, breakfast and lunch menus, and evening events. Another Flourish with a plant theme is already in the works in the Sycamore office complex of Bishop Ranch and will open in the near future.\n“What I learned with the big building, Lakeside, was if you don’t have things like this people don’t want to be there,” Mehran said.\nSome may want the gourmet coffee experience, others the extra conference space or the ability to entertain clients. Whatever tenants need, Mehran wants to be able to provide it because in today’s highly competitive office world, he said, developers can’t risk being caught without everything on tenants’ lengthy checklists.\n“It’s a binary thing,” he said. “It’s between a one and a zero of, ‘Am I going to sign a lease and have an office or am I not?’” he said.\nChanging Bishop Ranch also means finding new financing partners “who believe in you and allow you to make that shift,” Mehran said. Sunset has a long-standing relationship with Wells Fargo, which financed its purchase of Lakeside and the development of CityCenter, but it recently broadened to CitiGroup and Comerica, Mehran said.\nIt’s not easy getting a loan on offices, given the level of distress in the space and “it takes a long time for fear to exit these institutions,” Mehran said. But the new leases he’s been signing since 2022 seem like strong indications that people are figuring out their post-pandemic requirements, he said.\nIn all the uncertainty, Mehran said he’s keeping his eye on the long term, since that’s what Sunset does best.\n“I like progress,” he said. “We have a lot of energy behind us and what we’re doing is very tricky and has consequences for the next many, many decades. But we have a really thoughtful team and I believe in it.”\n",

Other members of the team include Aaron Appel, Keith Kurland, Jonathan Schwartz and Adam Schwartz, all of whom worked together back at JLL.\nThe new addition is a big get for W&amp;D. Last year, the capital markets team at the firm arranged capital totaling $16 billion from non-agency lenders. For his career, Stolly has arranged more than $100 billion in transactions.\n“Dustin’s experience, coupled with our existing team, will make W&amp;D’s capital markets and structured finance team one of the very best in the industry,” W&amp;D chair Willy Walker said in a statement.\nStolly\nleft his position\nas Newmark’s co-president of debt and structured finance in September after seven years with the company. Stolly and Jordan Roeschlaub formed one of the industry’s top capital markets teams. In the 12 months ending in March 2023, Stolly facilitated $29.1 billion of loans and $5.18 billion of equity. The duo also arranged $1.3 billion in loan sales over the same period, seemingly undaunted by rising interest rates.\nStolly also worked on Newmark’s push towards raising equity for platform and programmatic joint ventures.\n\nBefore joining Newmark in 2017, Stolly spent 10 years at JLL, where he closed $25 billion worth of capital market transactions and was managing director of the brokerage’s investment banking practice.\n“Walker &amp; Dunlop represents everything I am looking for in my next chapter — scale, vision and a relentless drive to lead the industry,” Stolly said in a statement about his move.\nWilly Walker suggested during a\nfourth quarter earnings report\nthat W&amp;D was ready to position itself for success in the new year.\n“Moving into 2025, we believe the worst of the Great Tightening is behind us and that W&amp;D is extremely well positioned to meet the market needs over the next several years,” Walker said at the time.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "Storefronts in historic Jackson Square are hot — and a luxury alternative to Union Square.\nWhile Ralph Lauren has returned to San Francisco with a new store at 441 Jackson Street, restaurateur Peter Hemsley and the Brick &amp; Timber Collective have paid $32.4 million for a 15,600-square-foot store and building at 530 Jackson Street, the\nSan Francisco Chronicle\nand the\nSan Francisco Business Times\nreported.\nThe tony district that harkens back to the Gold Rush has seen an\ninflux of luxury retailers\nlike Paul Smith, Isabel Marant and Zimmermann. At the same time, many retailers have left nearby Union Square, with an\nexit planned by Macy’s\n.\nNew York-based Ralph Lauren had a store at 2040 Fillmore Street, which closed in 2020.  It also had a location in the\nCrocker Galleria\nthat shuttered in 2013.\nIts new store, which replaces a Senreve apparel shop, was designed to reflect the rich history of Jackson Square, with a contemporary twist, an unidentified Ralph Lauren spokesperson told the Chronicle. It’s dark green, with hand-painted gold leaf and brass signs, along with stained oak floors and white-painted brick walls.\nTerms of the lease, as well as the owner of the building, were not disclosed.\n“The opening of Polo Ralph Lauren in Jackson Square is a testament to the neighborhood’s growing appeal as a premier destination for retail,” Robbie Silver, CEO of the Downtown SF Partnership,\nsaid in a statement\n.\nIt was Hemsley who announced last year he would shut down the Michelin-starred Aphotic, pointing the blame squarely to its location in South of Market.\n“There are few left in San Francisco that aspire to provide services like we do at Aphotic, and the smart and lucky ones in the pack are located in the right storefront, on the right block, and in the right part of town,” he wrote on Instagram.\nNow Hemsley seems to have found that right location.\n\nIn a deal that closed last week, he and the locally based Brick &amp; Timber bought the Jackson Street storefront a block from the Ralph Lauren shop for $2,075 per square foot, the Business Times reported, citing public records and unidentified sources.\nThe seller of the four-story office and retail building was the McAleese family, which has run the former Kells Irish Pub and Restaurant and occupied its ground floor for more than two decades.\nBrick &amp; Timber plans to revamp the building, and keep it for the long haul, according to founder Glenn Gilmore.\nPartner Jesse Feldman described Hemsley as “a world-class culinary talent,” and said the pair mutually felt the building would serve as “a special location for the next chapter in his story,” according to a statement.\nIt’s not clear whether the chef intends to revive Aphotic, or launch a new restaurant.\nJackson Square has emerged as a bright spot in Downtown San Francisco. Former Apple designer Jony Ive has\nspent almost $100 million\nbuying up buildings in the area. There’s also Michael Shvo’s $1 billion bet on the Transamerica Pyramid.\nBrick &amp; Timber, founded in 2013 by Glenn Gilmore, developed its chops\nturning Gold Rush-era warehouses into offices for venture capitalists\nalong the North Waterfront. With nine buildings in Jackson Square, the Jackson Square-based collective is “arguably the predominant real estate investor” in the North Waterfront, partner Jesse Feldman\ntold The Real Deal last month\n.\nIn December, the firm bought an eight-story 115,600-square-foot building at 500 Washington Street for $32.7 million, or $282 per square foot,\nTRD reported.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "BODY TEXT:\nOne of Texas’ fastest-growing towns is about to get bigger, as one of the county’s largest homebuilders snapped up 75 acres.\nLennar bought the acreage from Ray Johnston, a Dallas country singer and land investor, for a future single-family home development, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe land, sold through Johnston’s No Bad Days LLC, lies along FM 982 near Princeton, Texas, about 40 miles northeast of downtown Dallas and one of several boom towns refitting Dallas-Fort Worth suburbia.\nTwo parcels were sold in the transaction: 32 acres closed on Dec. 5, and 42 acres on March 6.\nJohnston has been actively selling land in the area since 2021 after acquiring the property via 1031 exchange. The site was initially intended for self-storage development but pivoted toward residential use.\n\nJohnston also sold a nearby 1.2-acre pad last year, where a Dollar Tree opened in February. He still holds about 62 acres in the area, including 16 acres under contract with a multifamily developer and 5 acres brokered for retail.\nInfrastructure improvements are underway, with Johnston planning to sell the remaining land once sewer installations are completed this winter and a traffic light is installed by the Texas Department of Transportation.\nPrinceton is the nation’s third fastest-growing city; its population increased 22 percent from mid-2020 to mid-2023, U.S. Census data shows.\nIt is growing so fast that officials in January extended a moratorium on development, to address infrastructure needs, until this summer.\nLennar’s tracts are outside of the moratorium area, however.\n— Judah Duke\n",

So far, deeds for 40 units have been recorded by Miami-Dade County. Condos range from studios to three-bedroom units, spanning 466 square feet to 1,200 square feet, according to a press release.\nAmenities in the building include a pool deck, fitness center, pet spa, co-working lounge and a kids’ playroom, the website shows. Michelin-starred chef Carlo Mirarchi is also opening a seventh location of Roberta’s, his award-winning Brooklyn pizza restaurant, on the ground floor.\nCondo sales launched in 2023 with prices ranging from $700,000 to $2.4 million, with Cervera Real Estate leading sales and marketing. For remaining units, prices start at $800,000, the release shows.\n\nChudaitov said buyers for 72 Park have come “from all walks of life,” and included locals, as well as Californians, New Yorkers and Chicagoans. 72 Park marks the first condo completed in North Beach in five years. In 2017, Miami Beach\nresidents voted to increase density\nfor North Beach projects, setting the stage for\na new wave of development\nin the neighborhood.\n“I just see a really incredible community coming to life over there,” Chudaitov said.\nLefferts partnered with\nRussell Galbut\nto buy the 72 Park site for $17 million in 2015 and 2019, records show. Galbut is an investor in Lefferts’ North Beach projects, and helped secure\na $97.5 million construction loan\nfor 72 Park in 2022.\nLefferts’ other condo projects in the area include\nPalma Miami Beach Residences\nat 600 71st Street, a 14-story, 126-unit planned condo building that is 30 percent presold, the release shows. Also in the works is\n72 Carlyle\n, a 19-story, 134-unit luxury condo planned for 600 72nd Street, according to the release. Prices start at $1.8 million, and Douglas Elliman’s Eklund | Gomes Team is leading sales. Lefferts is also planning a four-story, 36-unit condo for 880 71st Street, the release shows.\n",

That works out to $100 per square foot.\nConstruction is expected to start in April and be completed by September.\nThe 200,000-square-foot office building was delivered in 1998. The property’s taxable value was $19.1 million last year, appraisal district records show.\nCorporate America’s push to return to the office has emphasized the flight-to-quality trend in the office market.\n\nThe effort to lure employees back to work with top-of-the-line amenities can be observed in recent deals like Lockton Companies’ 53,000-square-foot\nlease at Granite Park 6\n, a Plano office property that was delivered in 2023.\nMeanwhile, operators of older inventory, like 2900 West Plano Parkway, are under pressure to compete with new deliveries.\nThat’s just one segment of the Dallas-Fort Worth office market, which had 52.8 million square feet of unused office space in November. The Metroplex ranked third in the country for office vacancy, behind New York and Chicago.\nAT&amp;T Foundry is a network of “innovation centers” that aim to incubate new ideas in a startup environment. In addition to Plano, there are locations in Atlanta; Palo Alto, California; and Ra’anana, Israel. AT&amp;T Foundry opened a Plano office, its first hub, in 2011.

    "content": "Another nursing home in Queens traded hands this week, leaving questions about what the property’s future holds.\nNelson Tuchman sold the 55,000-square-foot facility at 111-26 Corona Avenue in Corona to an entity that shares an address with the Pinnacle Group of Hudson Valley for $56.4 million, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. Tuchman paid only $3.3 million for the 200-bed property back in 2008.\nTuchman was not reachable for comment, while a representative for the apparent Pinnacle Group affiliate declined to comment to the Observer.\nPinnacle Group is incorporated in Maine and owns facilities in and around the state; in 2020, it\nagreed to purchase two properties\nin the Portsmouth, New Hampshire area before the onset of the pandemic.\nThe Rego Park Health Care facility has been family owned and operated for more than 50 years, according to its website. The nursing home offers 24-hour nursing care, vacation care and short-term rehabilitation.\n\nNursing homes are an intriguing play for real estate investors. Occupancy rates tend to be strong and the United States is home to an increasingly aging population, meaning there will likely continue to be increased demand for spots in such facilities.\nLast year, Sentosa Care chief executive officer Ben Landa sold a 183-bed facility at 22-41 New Haven Avenue in the Queens neighborhood of Far Rockaway\nfor $47.3 million\n, a deal that worked out to more than $258,000 per bed. Landa also invested on the relative cheap, like Tuchman, buying the 49,000-square-foot facility for a mere $3 million in 2016 through his New Surfside Realty platform.\nBut changes at nursing homes — or struggles — can result in messy headlines.\nAt the start of the year, Bent and Avi Philipson placed a 588-unit nursing home facility\ninto Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection\nafter struggling to meet the weekly payroll at the Woodbury property. They’ve attempted an “emergency evacuation” of the property, putting hundreds of residents at risk of being displaced.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The Houston Planning Commission voted against it last week.\nThe owners don’t appear to have a history in real estate. The site plan was submitted by Houston-based CE Engineers &amp; Development Consultants.\nThe reduced setback was essential for including an enclosed parking garage in lieu of surface parking, the owner said.\n\nCity staff pushed back, saying the high-rise was “disproportionate to the size of the property” and inconsistent with the surrounding development patterns. The developers failed to prove financial hardship if the variance was denied, staffers said. Some neighborhood residents say the project is too big and would cause traffic.\nThe owners can submit a revised plan. Commissioner M. Sonny Garza suggested a full redesign of the project. Sumrith said no next steps have been decided but showed a desire not to proceed without neighborhood support.\nA number of major projects that came online last year are set to reshape the Montrose neighborhood.\nSkanska USA is planning Starling, a mixed-use development at 1001 Westheimer Road. The 31-story apartment tower will include 30,000 square feet of retail space, the Houston Chronicle\nreported\n.\nTannos Development Group and Wolfgramm Capital\naim to replace four aging apartment buildings\nwith high-end residences with their $30 million, 35-unit condo project on West Gray Street. Meanwhile, Radom Capital is redeveloping the former Tower Theatre into a mixed-use project with retail, dining and office space.

    "content": "Aby Rosen may have been kicked out of the Chrysler Building, but he wasn’t kicked off the block.\nRFR Holding is planning a redevelopment of the Trylons property next to the Chrysler Building, the New York Post\nreported\n. RFR owns the vacant property at 145-155 East 42nd Street, a much different situation than the ground lease environment of its next-door neighbor.\n“We always had the idea to redevelop it,” Rosen said of the triangular-topped Trylons, which was formerly occupied by Capital Grille.\nThe Trylons lot is only 13,000 square feet, but Rosen claims a property can be built up to 100,000 square feet as-of-right, perhaps growing taller after demolition. Depending on how big Rosen wants to go, he could also snap up air rights and even apply for an allowance under the Midtown East rezoning, potentially putting the property through ULURP.\nRosen’s goal is to redevelop the property and then lease it. He said what comes of the building will likely depend on market demand, though he likely isn’t willing to go under 100,000 square feet, for which he’d charge $10 million annually on a triple-net lease.\n\nPossibilities floated include experiential retail, a space for a technology brand or an auto dealership, which the RFR head claims has already drawn interest from car companies. Office and hotel spaces are also candidates.\nRFR started marketing the space last week and plans to draw more attention to the property going forward through MONA, its retail subsidiary. Rosen said it could take up to two years to pick a tenant or come up with a redesign.\nThat means Rosen will have plenty of time to lurk in the shadows of the Chrysler Building, which RFR leased before Cooper Union ejected them from the iconic property, a decision\naffirmed by a judge\nin January.\nRFR sued Cooper Union in September after the school tried to terminate the company’s ground lease. Cooper Union claimed the company stopped paying rent in June and racked up arrears to the tune of $21 million.\nRosen does not plan to appeal the judge’s ruling in the case.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "Chicago’s condo market set another record for this year.\nFormer Fortune Brands CEO Bruce Carbonari sold his 5,400-square-foot Gold Coast penthouse  in the Elm and State building for $10.1 million Friday, Crain’s\nreported\n. It sold for $1,870 per square foot and is the priciest home to sell in Chicago this year.\nIt hit the market\nin July for $10.8 million\n, about $2,000 per square foot, and found a buyer within two months but took six months to close.\nSellers Bruce and Kate Carbonari bought the entire 23rd floor as raw space for $6.7 million in 2016 and spent at least $1.5 million into the buildout, permit records show.\nThey bought when the building was new; the 194,000-square-foot tower at 4 East Elm was completed in 2016 and designed by SCB. It holds only two units per floor, ranging between 3,100 and 3,500 square feet and each is served by its own private elevator, according to SCB’s website.\nThe Carbonaris decided to sell after spending more time in Detroit with their grandchildren and at their Florida home. Bruce retired as Fortune Brands chairman and CEO after 22 years in 2011.\nSharon O’Hara and Carrie McCormick represented the sellers, and Emily Sachs Wong represented the buyers, all with @properties Christie’s International Real Estate. The buyer wasn’t identified.\nThe Carbonaris redesigned the living room and adjacent balcony to create an indoor-outdoor space featuring a 12-foot-high glass wall and french doors.\n\nThe result is a panoramic view spanning Chicago’s skyline, Lake Michigan and the surrounding neighborhoods. Additional terraces occupy the building’s northeast and northwest corners, with about 1,700 square feet of outdoor space.\nDowntown condos have accounted for eight of the top 10 highest-priced home sales in the Chicago area this year before counting two $12 million mansions and another $35 million home in Winnetka, which went under contract last week and in early February, respectively.\nChicago’s luxury condo market is\nshowing early signs of a rebound\nafter years of sluggish sales.\nUltra-high-end buyers have been selective, gravitating toward properties that avoid the stigma of long market stays or bulk sales.\nNewer projects, like Crescent Heights, at 850 Lake Shore Drive, have gained traction by pricing units competitively, while older developments like the St. Regis have struggled with slower sales and bulk transactions.\nSo far, 21 homes have sold for $4 million or more this year, outpacing the 16 sold by this time last year.\n— Judah Duke\n",

They are among the priciest deals in the area this year, along with a $35 million mansion that went under contract in early February.\nThe 9,650-square-foot, seven-bedroom home at 973 Sheridan Road, was built five years ago on about 2 acres. It was listed on Feb. 15 and went under contract in 12 days. The asking price came to $1,245 per square foot.\nBuilt in 2020 by Paul Konstant and Scott Lyon &amp; Company, the two-story mansion has an elevator, a sports court, golf simulator, home theater, playroom with bunk room and a guest house with designated parking.\nThe land was purchased for $6.19 million in 2017 by a trust associated with Luke and Margaret Kelly. Agents Cricket King and John Baylor with @properties Christie’s International Real Estate had the listing.\nThe mansion at 765 Sheridan Road was built in 2005. The 15,800-square-foot, seven-bedroom home includes a pool and spa, stone terraces, an outdoor kitchen, gym, bar and elevator. It asked about $760 per square foot.\n\nIt initially hit the market in August for $18 million. After a price drop to just under $15 million, sellers Morris Silverman and Lori Komisar switched agents to Jena Radnay of @properties Christie’s and reduced the price to just under $12 million.\nThis year’s highest-priced home sales so far include two downtown Chicago condos in the $8.9 million range at\nthe St. Regis\non the Chicago River and One Chicago at Chicago Avenue and State Street.\nTwo Winnetka homes sold for over $12 million in 2023, and one in 2022, when billionaire private equity executive Justin Ishiba assembled a $39.9 million site for a\nmansion projected to cost over $44 million\nto build.\nAnother Winnetka home, which hit the market Friday, is asking $10.3 million ($1,275 per square foot) at 381 Sheridan Road.\nBuilt in 2015, that 8,000-square-foot home has six bedrooms, a theater room, sports simulator, home gym, two spa baths and two walk-in closets.

A 19-story boutique condominium with 37 units would replace the older buildings, the application shows.\nAn affiliate of\nKolter\n, led by CEO Bobby Julien, is under contract to purchase the Normandy Plaza Hotel, records show. BH, led by Liat and Isaac Toledano, and Kolter paid\n$24 million\nfor the 84-room Crystal Beach in 2023, but last month put the property on the market for more than four times their purchase price. The site is being marketed by Berkadia.\nKolter and BH did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBuilt in 1950, the Crystal Beach hotel is not a historic property, but the four-story building is within the city’s North Beach Historic District. Normandy Plaza is a three-story building designed by famous Miami Beach architect L. Murray Dixon. As a result, demolition of both hotels requires approval from the Miami Beach Historic Preservation Board.\nNormandy Plaza is “derelict and the subject of a Miami-Dade County Unsafe Structures Board order,” according to a letter of intent submitted by the joint venture’s land use lawyer, Michael Larkin.\nDesigned by Kobi Karp Architecture &amp; Interior Design, the planned condominium’s 37 units would each span 8,760 square feet with decks and balconies measuring 2,650 square feet, the site plan shows. The project would also include 80 parking spaces and 2,607 square feet of ground-floor retail.\nKolter and BH are also developing\nSolana Bay\n, a 10-story waterfront boutique condominium with 52 units in North Miami.",

    "content": "Tenants in Los Angeles won a temporary victory as their landlords are now barred by the city from evicting them over major renovations.\nThe City Council unanimously voted on an ordinance launched by Council member Bob Blumenfield to temporarily bar landlords from booting tenants in order to complete a “substantial remodel,”\nCity News Service reported\n.\nThe eviction ban during renovations will last through Aug. 1, while city staff work on a permanent solution to “close a loophole” proponents say allows investors to kick out tenants for remodeling, then jack up rents. To take effect, it will require approval by Mayor Karen Bass.\nDavid Kaishchyan of the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles said the policy will force renters to live in dangerous conditions, while tying the hands of responsible owners.\n“This ordinance is a result of a witch hunt by extremists that want to force mom-and-pop owners out of business,” Kaishchyan told the council.\nHe claimed data from the city’s Housing Department show that “renovictions” are a “hoax,” with less than 100 substantial remodels occurring in the past two years.\n“We strongly urge a ‘no vote’ on this outrageous moratorium that once again rips the rug out from under housing providers and shows the city to be unreliable and openly hostile to them,” Kaishchyan said.\nThe ordinance will retroactively apply to tenants, meaning it could provide a defense in court for renters who have yet to receive judgment for this particular eviction proceeding, according to City News.\nThe city deems a substantial remodel as a “no-fault” eviction, in which tenants in good standing can be evicted if their unit requires major structural, electrical, plumbing or mechanical system work.\n\nProperty owners must self-certify that it will take 30 days or more to complete such projects.\nLandlords of rent-stabilized units, however, must provide a plan to temporarily relocate tenants if the unit requires a substantial remodel. The plan must be submitted to the Housing Department, and the tenant has to agree before it can be carried out.\nLast year, the council approved a motion introduced by Blumenfield, who called for the temporary ban on evictions for substantial remodels, saying an ordinance would “close a loophole.”\n“Hundreds of families are caught in this type of eviction process, with no ability to keep their units,” Blumenfield said in a previous statement. “My policy will ensure that a tenant has the ability to maintain tenancy, keep paying rent and stay in their apartments.”\nCouncil members worried that some units taken off the market for remodeling are added later at higher rents.\nThe City Council also instructed the Housing Department to provide information on how many property owners are applying for substantial remodels, how many projects have been completed and how many evictions are caused by efforts to electrify units.\nLaura Matter, a senior staff attorney with Inner City Law Center, said many renters in L.A. are facing eviction proceedings related to substantial remodeling efforts.\n“This is a provision that investors use to flip properties and it goes against the purpose of Just Cause Ordinance, which was to prohibit arbitrary evictions,” Matter told the council.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

A foreclosure auction is on the books for April 10.\nThe Philadelphia-based developer landed a $66.7 million loan from AllianceBernstein two years ago, but the balance has since ballooned to $77.9 million. The loan matured a few months ago.\nPost Brothers president Matthew Pestronk expressed hope the issue could be resolved amicably and with the developer still in place, saying the company was “actively working” on raising funds.\nPost Brothers acquired the property in 2023 from Network Realty Partners and Meadow Partners for $66.7 million. The office asset was previously the longtime home of the Urban Institute before an announced departure in 2017.\n\nIn October, the developer secured approval from the Board of Zoning Adjustment for a conversion to a 400-unit apartment building with 20,000 square feet of ground floor retail space, according to the\nCommercial Observer\n.\nWhile Post Brothers fights for its West End redevelopment, the firm is forging ahead with the district’s largest conversion so far. The developer’s $400 million conversion of the Universal Buildings at 1825 and 1875 Connecticut Avenue NW is expected to yield 600 units and 700,000 square feet. Post Brothers tapped a 20-year tax incentive for conversions in the district, which is expected to save the company $95 million in property taxes.\nD.C. ranks\nsecond in the nation\nin office-to-residential unit pipeline, according to RentCafe, trailing only New York City. There are 71,000 units in the national pipeline, a record-breaking total in the firm’s tracking and a tripling of the number of units in the works three years ago.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Buyers signed a dozen contracts between March 3 and March 9. The report tracks listings of these properties marked in the Multiple Listing Service.\nForty-six luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,341 listings.\nThe asking dollar volume for the seven single-family homes and five condos under contract totals $137.4 million, according to the report, which is authored by the Douglas Elliman star-studded team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\nThe 9,700-square-foot, six-bedroom and six-and-a-half-bathroom mansion at 55 East San Marino Drive on San Marino Island was under construction when the sellers purchased it.

    "content": "Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has canceled six federal office leases in Dallas-Fort Worth.\nThe eliminations cut more than $1.12 million in annual rent, D Magazine\nreported\n. They are part of the Trump administration’s broader effort to reduce the government’s real estate costs.\nThe leases total 44,000 square feet and house agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Food and Drug Administration and the Office of Inspector General.\nThe move is part of DOGE’s ongoing lease-cutting spree nationwide, which so far has tallied 748 terminations totaling 9.6 million square feet and about $468 million in cuts, according to its\nwebsite\n. The cuts are aimed at eliminating underutilized office space and consolidating government operations, the agency said.\nThe terminations come as the federal government is considering selling off several major buildings in Texas, including large office properties in\nDallas, Fort Worth, Austin\nand\nHouston\n. The General Services Administration briefly published a list of 443 federal buildings being considered for disposal.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the six leases DOGE has canceled in DFW. The addresses weren’t reported.\n8,900 square feet at Midway Atriums II, at 14285 Midway Road in Addison: $217,084 annual rent from the Defense Contract Management Agency. The lease effective April 2012 was set to expire in April 2027.\n5,800 square feet in Irving (building and address not specified): $115,742 annual rent from the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations. The lease effective April 2024 was set to expire in April 2029.\n15,000 square feet in Harwood Center, at 1999 Bryan Street: $423,186 annual rent from the Federal Trade Commission. Fortis Property Group is the landlord. The lease effective 2015 was set to expire in August.\n2,000 square feet at Lake Highlands Tower, at 9330 Lyndon B Johnson Freeway in Dallas: $60,630 annual rent from the Federal Communications Commission. Lease effective 2019 was set to expire in 2029\n5,900 square feet at Overton Centre Tower II, at 4150 International Plaza in Fort Worth: $157,720 annual rent from the Federal Railroad Administration. Lease effective 2014 was set to expire in 2029.\n6,400 square feet at Brookhollow Riverside, at 2505 North State Highway 360 Service Road East in Grand Prairie: $152,938 annual rent from the Office of Inspector General. Lease effective November 2015 was set to expire in 2030.\nThere are 32 other leases across Texas confirmed as terminated on DOGE’s website. Many will result in $0 in savings, including for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s 7,200-square-foot lease in Houston and the Federal Railroad Administration’s 5,800-square-foot lease in Fort Worth.\nThat’s likely because the government will have to pay\nlease termination penalties\n.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "Compass, which has been touting the growing popularity of its private exclusives, recently brought its inventory push in-house, offering agents and their clients a marketing incentive to begin their listings off the MLS.\nThe brokerage offered a $100 social media campaign for every listing an agent has that begins as a Compass private exclusive and moves to a Compass “coming soon,” according to an email to agents from Compass CEO Robert Reffkin obtained by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe campaign will help agents in “winning more listings, getting more buyer leads, boosting visibility of your listing page on Google, helping sell your listing faster, and securing more signed Buyer Representation Agreements,” Reffkin wrote in the email.\nThe incentive program, which began on Feb. 1 and runs through the end of May, comes amid debate in the industry over the value of private listings. Independent brokerages, listing services and aggregators have dug their heels in about the value of listing homes publicly, while Reffkin has been trumpeting the need for consumer choice in how they list their home.\nThe National Association of Realtors’ Clear Cooperation Policy\nrestricts how Compass can market listings\noff-MLS, something\nReffkin has repeatedly criticized\n. More recently, he has been pushing the popularity of private exclusive listings and “coming soon” listings as evidence that consumers want the ability to freely list off the MLS.\nBut the internal incentives to keep listings from going directly on the MLS calls into question how enthusiastic consumers are to list their homes as private exclusives and opens the brokerage to criticism that keeping listings off the MLS helps, more than anybody, itself and its shareholders.\nThe inventory play\nCompass’ strategy around building its off-MLS listings has come as part of a larger push to build its inventory and compete not just with brokerages,\nbut listing services and aggregators\n.\nThe company has recently been promoting its “3-Phased Marketing Strategy,” which entails moving sellers’ listings through a funnel from private exclusives to only being available on compass.com as a  “coming soon,” to finally being on the MLS.\n“Our goal is to make it clear that Compass agents and Compass.com have more inventory than third-party sites, sending a strong signal to buyers that if you aren’t working with Compass agents or aren’t searching Compass, you are not seeing all the inventory,” Reffkin said on earnings calls last year.\nThe other benefit for Compass — aside from potentially attracting clients and agents who don’t want to miss out on homes that are listed off the MLS — is that the company is more likely to co-broke a deal when only Compass agents can see private exclusive listings.\n“You always want to give a listing maximum exposure and have all eyes on it,” Brown Harris Stevens CEO Bess Freedman said. “It’s not for some greater good, like he’s trying to help the world. He’s trying to get as much money as he can.”\nIn a\nblog post\nlast month, Zillow CEO Jeremy Wacksman wrote that the use of private listings is “designed to benefit a participating brokerage’s own bottom line as an attempt to ‘double dip’ on commissions from both sides of the transaction within their brokerage.”\n“At Compass, we co-broke with everyone,” Reffkin said in a press release earlier this week noting that agents from other brokerages can see “Compass Coming Soon” listings by going to Compass.com.\n\nGood for who?\nBut Reffkin has also been on his soapbox about the benefits consumers get from marketing their homes off-MLS at first.\nIn addition to metrics on the benefits of pre-marketing, Reffkin also posted that\n94 percent of Compass listings sell on the MLS\n. A spokesperson for Compass said this reflects “the primary value to homeowners is pre-marketing, including ever-important price discovery.”\nHe has also pointed to the growing number of Compass’ off-MLS listings as evidence of the consumer demand for alternative listing strategies. On this past quarter’s earnings call, he said that the 7,500 listings “only available by working with [a] Compass agent or by searching Compass.com” was “early proof” of the value consumers were seeing from keeping their listings being publicly searchable on the MLS.\nBut according to Jason Oppenheim, president of his eponymous West Hollywood brokerage, the agent incentives are evidence that consumer interest in these exclusives is “not organic.”\n“We knew they were encouraging their agents regardless, but now there’s a blatant financial incentive to do it,” he said. “If they’re doing this for the client, then why would you need to incentivize agents?”\nStreetEasy’s general manager Caroline Burton added that agents who are “incentivized to push private listing networks must understand the negative impacts to the clients they serve.”\n“It’s an inherent conflict,” said Freedman. “Our obligation is to the seller. When we sign an exclusive with them, we are to put their interests first ahead of our own. That’s like the golden rule. This is putting Compass’ interests first.”\nA spokesperson for Compass replied to the claim by citing internal research that showed that homes with “strategic pre-marketing” were associated with 2.9 percent higher closing prices and received offers 20 percent faster.\n“We are doubling down on our commitment to better serve homeowners by offering a limited-time complimentary social media campaign designed to maximize the return on what’s likely their most valuable asset,” the spokesperson said in an email.\nIn addition to the individual incentives, Compass is also running an incentive for offices: the first five that have an 80 percent adoption rate of the company’s phased marketing strategy, which entails first listing homes off-MLS, will receive local marketing campaigns including billboards and social media ads.\nReffkin wrote in the email that by participating in the incentive program, “we can protect home values, elevate your role as an agent, and maximize outcomes for your clients.”\nOne former Compass agent who received the email said the company has always encouraged agents to use its off-MLS tools, but that the push has ramped up in the past year.\n“Is Compass trying to create a competitive advantage or are they doing what’s best for the customer,” the agent said. “To incentivize agents to do it for every listing, who does that benefit?”",

    "content": "Infamous landowner Suzie Wilson is facing a potential ban from owning Chicago property, after inspiring the creation of the city’s new special collections unit designed to help go after its largest, most indebted landlords more efficiently.\nThe city is pushing to bar Wilson — who racked up over $15 million in fines for municipal property violations — from ever investing in Chicago real estate again as part of any settlement that might be reached in her bankruptcy, deputy city attorney David Holtkamp said. And Chicago’s efforts to crack down on negligent property owners aren’t going to end with her.\nThe playbook used to take down Wilson forms the basis for the city’s new special collections unit — a group of attorneys housed under the Chicago Law Department’s Collections, Ownership, and Administrative Litigation Division. It hired three more attorneys with funds recovered from Wilson’s debts and will work with the city’s Department of Streets and Sanitation to monitor property inspections and citations for landowners that owe significant amounts to the city.\nThey are starting with about 10 landowners in particular that hit a certain threshold of unpaid fines and fees with the city, including two the city has publicly filed “additional enforcement actions” against in recent months. Those are Hinsdale-based QCD Financial and Grayslake-based Goldmine Investments, which the city referred to as large-scale “land speculators” that “gobble up vacant lots in hopes of getting rich,” according to city litigation.\nQCD has been found liable “at least 1,618 times” for municipal code violations across 125 properties it owns, allegedly amassing over $3.8 million in fines and interest since 2013, according to court records. Goldmine allegedly owes the city over $5.2 million in fines from more than 1,500 counts of blight-related code violations, records show.\nIn both cases, the special collections unit moved to consolidate judgements made against the owners in city administrative hearings into lawsuits filed with the Cook County Circuit Court over the last few months.\n“Once you discover a pattern and a practice, then that allows you to begin an entire mechanism of researching and tracking down owners,” said Mary Richardson-Lowry, Chicago’s top legal advisor.\nShe wouldn’t disclose the identity of the other landowners being targeted by the collections unit or the amount of debt the city is using as its threshold to pursue. Most own vacant lots, like Wilson, but some also own occupied residential properties, Holtkamp said in a statement. (\nThe Real Deal\nhas made a formal public records request to determine the property owners.)\nRichardson-Lowry recalled talking to aldermen about the trouble they were having with negligent landowners like these just a few months after she was hired by the city in June of 2023.\nThe city lacked a system to track the ownership of vacant lots that weren’t being cared for, especially when owners didn’t want to be found, and Richardson-Lowry wanted to change that, she said.\nWith Holtkamp, she began to uncover just how pervasive the issue of abandoned, vacant lots in the city is, she said. Private owners held nearly 32,000 vacant lots in Chicago as of the 2021 tax year, according to\nCook County Assessor data\n.\nThey found many non-responsive owners who don’t keep their lots clean, fail to pay taxes or fines on time, and shift the property’s ownership between countless legal entities to avoid being tracked, Richardson-Lowry said.\nBut there was one name that stood out from the rest, one they kept seeing: Suzie Wilson.\nSo, they went after her with every tool they had: enforcing existing judgments, bringing new cases and connecting her name to the legal entities that many of her properties were purchased under.\nA year-and-a-half later, she was\nforced to sell 812 properties\nas part of a bankruptcy case filed in the fall. The properties, which are being marketed by Hilco Real Estate, are concentrated in low-income areas, predominantly on the South and West sides of the city.\n“These are communities where blight is viewed as part of their DNA,” Richardson-Lowry said. “Now we have a person that we can directly attribute to part of the cause of the blight in certain communities. So, that’s how we began.”\nAn attorney representing Wilson and various LLCs named as “interested parties” in the bankruptcy filing did not respond to requests for comment. An attorney for Wilson’s B.A.S.S. &amp; M, Inc. and other companies named as debtors also did not respond to requests for comment. A representative of Goldmine didn’t return a request for comment and attempts to reach QCD weren’t successful.\nSavvy scavengers\nWilson began investing in Chicago real estate with her sister and business partner, Swedlana Dass, in 1987, according to a declaration Wilson made as part of the bankruptcy filed in October.\nIn 1989, Wilson’s husband, Michael Wilson, began helping them purchase commercial and residential properties through Cook County’s scavenger and annual tax sales, according to Wilson’s declaration. Back then, scavenger sales were held every two years for properties with taxes that were more than three years behind. Buyers bid on the properties, with bids starting at $250, and the highest bidder won a lien on the property.\nIt’s a little different than Cook County’s annual tax sale, where buyers bid on property tax debt, not the properties themselves — meaning the scavenger sale properties are at an even deeper level of distress. However, if the property owner does not pay their tax debt back to the buyer within a certain period, then tax buyers can file a petition to take over ownership of the property.\nThe tax buyer is still required to pay back any unpaid property taxes remaining on the property if they do take over the deed, though, which is why people looking to acquire land at a low cost typically gravitate more toward scavenger sales, where properties can be sold for even less than their delinquent taxes and interest owed.\n\nWilson was among the investors who used these sales to accumulate a massive amount of land very quickly. She and Dass, through their various companies, acquired over 800 commercial and residential properties over 32 years. The lots have an estimated market value of $17.8 million, according to court filings. Most of the properties are vacant lots, but Wilson did lease some of them to businesses, generating about $290,000 in annual rent revenue, according to her declaration.\nIllinois passed reforms in 2023 that made scavenger sales optional and\nclosed a long-criticized loophole\nthat allowed tax buyers to get refunds should they find a way to claim property was sold in error.\nScavenger sales are “unlikely to be held again” in the county, given the reforms, a Cook County Treasurer’s Office spokesperson said, acknowledging that the sales were a vessel “through which many properties were acquired by investors at low cost.”\n“It’s much more difficult for investors to acquire properties at an annual tax sale because they must pay all back taxes, and in about 95 percent of cases, the taxpayer pays off their tax debt before the investors can take title to the property,” the spokesperson said.\nThe main thing that brought Wilson onto the city’s radar was the sheer volume of code violations she racked up, amassing $15 million in unpaid municipal tickets for dumping garbage on vacant lots and failing to address\nrat infestations\ncaused by the dumping.\nThat affects neighboring residential and commercial buildings as rat infestations spread and run-off from discarded metal products leaches into the soil, Richardson-Lowry said, calling Wilson “the worst offender that we’ve found so far.”\nIt took a while to connect the dots on just how many properties Wilson owned, Richardson-Lowry said. First, they thought it was 200. Then, it was 500. And finally, over 800 properties were found to be owned by Wilson or companies associated with her or Dass.\nWhen Wilson wasn’t responsive to the city’s requests for her to clean up her properties, Holtkamp and his team decided to get serious.\nThree-pronged approach\nFirst, they enforced any preexisting judgements they had against Wilson and her companies in the city’s Department of Administrative Hearings, registering them all as cases with the Circuit Court of Cook County.\nOver 5,000 new complaints were filed against Wilson in Circuit Court, Holtkamp said. They consolidated the cases and pursued them “very, very aggressively,” digging for evidence and freezing bank accounts.\nThen, the city filed separate cases in the Circuit Court to petition a judge for temporary restraining orders requiring Wilson to clean up specific properties immediately, which was successful in some cases, Holtkamp said.\nLast April, for example,\nthe city sued Wilson and her company Regal LLC\n, seeking over $10 million in damages over a vacant lot in the Englewood neighborhood on the South Side. Large stacks of tires dumped on the property were cleaned up in April after the city sent letters notifying Wilson and Regal of the impending litigation,\nIllinois Answers Project reported\n.\nThe final and perhaps most important approach taken by Holtkamp and his team is that they started suing and issuing any new citations not just to the entities that owned each property, but to the people behind them, he said.\nNow, the city is naming the individual owners behind LLCs, whenever possible, as soon as the owner receives a citation with the city.\nThat way, “when we have those judgments and we seek to enforce them, we will be able to freeze their personal assets, and that is quite a motivator,” Holtkamp said.\nThe city is suing Wilson for at least $46 million between the preexisting judgments filed in court and new lawsuits brought by the city, Holtkamp said. But there are other citations still pending, he added.\nWilson’s companies filed for bankruptcy as the lawsuits and fines accumulated. In response, the city accused Wilson and her sister, Dass, of fraud, claiming they hid their wealth by transferring ownership of local properties around to businesses based in South Dakota until their Illinois companies appeared penniless.\nThe city objected to the bankruptcy filing to make sure it was “protected as a creditor and that things would be done appropriately” — an issue that has since been resolved, according to Steve Madura of Hilco Real Estate, who is selling Wilson’s 812 properties.\nThe bankruptcy case is ongoing. Wilson has begun to pay back some of the fines she owes the city, about $1 million so far, Holtkamp said, adding that they “expect to see quite a bit more by the end of sales.”\nProceeds from the sale will also go to repaying Wilson’s debts to two other lenders — Charles L. Walker and New York-based global alternative asset manager Nine Left Capital.\n",

Mayor Karen Bass touted Friday’s lifting of the Pacific Palisades “Do Not Drink” notice as her communications team hailed what they said is a recovery tracking ahead of expectations.\nA group that emerged this past week views things differently. The\nnewly formed committee\nlooks to lead a recall of Bass, accusing her of failed leadership, most recently in response to the fires and more broadly when it comes to the city’s direction.\nPaperwork for the committee’s formation was filed with both the state and city, backed by major funding from former Robert F.

That’s because the nonprofit he recently founded, called Steadfast LA, is working with prefab homebuilder Samara to give away 100 homes, according to statements Caruso made during the annual Montgomery Summit in Santa Monica.\n“Unprecedented building boom” headed for LA: Permitting first maze to navigate\nSure, state and city leaders promised to cut the red tape on rebuilding in areas burned by the Palisades and Eaton fires, but homeowners will still face an uphill climb even before dirt begins turning over the next few years.\nPart of Los Angeles County will see an\n“unprecedented building boom,”\nMarmol Radziner managing partner Leo Marmol said Feb. 27 during a Palisades community meeting.\nHomeowners will be forced onto an accelerated track that makes them home builders in some ways, learning industry terminology in an abbreviated period while trying to understand how to navigate the city’s permit and building process.\nDOGE hacks away at LA federal office leases with early exits\nLos Angeles landlords Oaktree Capital Management, Jamison, Onni Group and more are in the crosshairs of the federal government’s bid to save taxpayer money.

The feds bought it for $1.2 million ($4.61 per square foot) in 1941. Its tenants include the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Diplomatic Security Bureau.\nIn Fort Worth, the 669,000-square-foot Fritz G. Lanham Federal Building, at 819 Taylor Street, is on the chopping block. It was built in 1966 and houses a post office and regional offices of the Social Security Administration and the GSA itself.\nThe J.J. Pickle Federal building at 300 East Eighth Street is among the 1 million square feet of office buildings in Austin DOGE wants sold. The 215,000-square-foot building was built in 1964, and former President Lyndon B. Johnson had his personal office there from 1963 to 1969.\nCuts to federal real estate by DOGE could lead to increased vacancies in cities already struggling with low occupancy. Austin, Dallas and Houston, for example, have office vacancy rates of 25 percent or more.\n\nThe downsizing could also create a ripple effect, impacting local economies as federal employees potentially work from home, reducing foot traffic and demand for nearby services.\nHere’s what else happened in Texas Real Estate this week:\nWeinreb Ventures\nis advancing its Frisco\nmegadevelopment\nwith the construction of the Ardea at Grand Place, a 301-unit project set to begin in September and complete by December 2027.

    "content": "Investors say real estate crowdfunding platform CrowdStreet helped facilitate a multimillion-dollar fraud by way of a Chicago office building, and now they want a refund.\nA group of 125 investors is taking legal action against the Austin-based investment platform, alleging it facilitated fraud in Nightingale Properties’ $130 million acquisition of 200 West Jackson Boulevard, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nThe investors are demanding $7.2 million in damages from CrowdStreet, plus interest, fees and punitive damages, in a claim filed this week with the Arbitration Service of Portland.\nCrowdStreet failed to do its due diligence on Nightingale and its CEO Elie Schwartz before allowing the firm to raise $25 million for its 2022 purchase of the 29-story tower in the Chicago Loop, the investors claim.\nSchwartz has\nsince pleaded guilty to wire fraud\nfor misappropriating $54 million CrowdStreet funneled to him for failed office deals in\nAtlanta\nand\nMiami Beach\n.\nThe West Jackson investors accuse CrowdStreet of misrepresenting Nightingale’s financial commitment by stating the firm would contribute $11.7 million in equity to the deal. In reality, at least $5.8 million of that capital was never put in, the investors claim.\nNightingale bought the tower for $130 million in January 2022. It was financed with an $86 million CMBS loan from Citibank and a $17 million mezzanine loan from Kawa Capital Management.\n\nThe landlord is up to date on loan payments, and the building was 82 percent leased as of September, according to a letter to investors from CrowdStreet, which said JLL had since taken over operations and control of the property’s bank accounts.\nCrowdStreet knew — or should have known — about Nightingale’s misconduct but continued promoting its deals, investors argue, while granting it “enterprise-level sponsor” status, the platform’s highest designation.\nCrowdStreet dismissed the claims as “meritless” and said it would present its case in arbitration.\nThe latest arbitration follows a separate 2024 claim with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, in which a dozen investors sought to shut down CrowdStreet’s broker-dealer operations after losing $1.5 million in failed Nightingale deals.\nSchwartz caused 800 investors to send about $62.8 million for real estate investments that he diverted for his own use, according to federal prosecutors. He awaits sentencing, facing a maximum of 20 years in prison.\n— Judah Duke",

    "content": "Calling all architects! The City of Los Angeles has launched a design contest for how best to squeeze the most for-sale homes inside a small city-owned lot.\nThe Los Angeles initiative, dubbed Small Lots, Big Impacts, features a design competition for architects to draw up plans for multiple small homes on one lot to cut the cost of starter homes,\nthe Los Angeles Times reported\n.\nThe city also aims to show how Los Angeles can pack in more homes without turning into Manhattan.\n“Angelenos should be able to buy their first home and raise their families in our city,” Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement. “The launch of Small Lots, Big Impacts is a step toward that future.”\nThe idea is simple: the winning multiple homes designs would ultimately serve as preapproved templates for all developers to use.\nThe city intends to sell 10 small lots to allow builders to show what the new designs can do. The city has around 1,000 small lots, which it could sell to developers with City Council approval, the proceeds for which could help residents buy the new homes.\nThe initiative is a partnership between the city, the public-private\nLA4LA\nand\nUCLA’s cityLAB research center\n, which found 24,000 vacant lots smaller than a quarter acre where housing is allowed in L.A.\nThe goal of Small Lots, Big Impacts: to create for-sale homes that are smaller and less expensive than a McMansion, or a 2,000-square-foot townhome.\n“That isn’t on the market” today, cityLAB director Dana Cuff told the Times.\n\nWhat is on the market on most smaller lots are either large single-family houses or between three to five large townhomes.\nOr nothing on such lots get built at all because high construction costs mean projects won’t pencil out unless developers can combine adjacent lots to build one large apartment building, Azeen Khanmalek, who formerly worked in the mayor’s office and is now executive director of the advocacy group Abundant Housing, told the newspaper.\nArchitects are being asked to design for multiple homes on one lot, but contest organizers want the homes to have natural light, access to the outdoors and a “comfortable relationship with neighbors.”\nDesigners are also encouraged to use innovative construction materials and methods to protect against fire and bring down the cost of construction. Projects are likely to have between four and 20 units, with building heights from one to three stories.\nCuff hopes the design competition and subsequent homes being built on city lots will show developers they can make money doing the same thing on land that’s now privately owned.\nShe also hopes it will show the general public that L.A. doesn’t have to rely on skyscrapers.\n“These projects I think will really demonstrate that living together, with slightly more households on a site, is going to be a pretty nice arrangement,” Cuff told the Times.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

The seller is Nashville-based Carter-Haston Holdings.\nFinancial details of the deal weren’t made public, but the buyer assumed a $35.6 million mortgage ($101,000 per unit) with an interest rate of 3.36 percent in the transaction. The loan from 2019 still has its full principal amount.\nThe property’s taxable value is $68.1 million, appraisal district records show. Its valuation has jumped nearly 30 percent since 2020, when it was appraised at $52.5 million\nSorrel Phillips Creek Ranch was built in 2015. CenterSquare plans to renovate the property by upgrading the units, fitness center and tenant lounge.\n\nDue to its massive population growth, Frisco leads the Metroplex in multifamily construction. About 8,000 units are expected to be delivered in Frisco, Allen and McKinney, according to Partners Real Estate.\nThe historic surge of supply has dampened rental rates throughout the Metroplex, but strong demand means high-growth suburbs like Frisco will continue to outperform, Partners said. Multifamily operators are betting the bottom of the multifamily market is in the rearview mirror and they’ll be able to ride the wave of rental rate increases with purchases.\nPart of the coming deluge of deliveries will be in the form of megadevelopments in Frisco’s pipeline.\nUpcoming projects include Firefly Park, a 217-acre project from Wilks Development that’s expected to cost between $2.5 and $4 billion, as well as an unnamed project from David Weinreb’s\nWeinreb Ventures\n, which is expected to deliver 1,039 units in its first phase.\n",

    "content": "PSAI Realty Partners has picked up three office buildings in Campbell for $54 million — a 62 percent discount from an investor buy-in six years ago.\nAn affiliate of the San Francisco-based investor bought an 18-story, 119,300-square-foot tower, a 10-story, 119,000-square-foot highrise and six-story, 126,700-square-foot building at 1901 South Bascom Avenue, southwest of San Jose,\nthe Silicon Valley Business Journal reported\n.\nThe sellers were Ellis Partners, based in San Francisco, and Los Angeles-based Oaktree Capital Management.\nThe deal for the 365,000 square feet of offices built in the 1970s works out to $148 per square foot. Eastdil Secured represented the sellers in the deal.\nThe sale marks an $87.5 million differential from what Oaktree had invested in the office campus six years earlier.\nIn 2019, Oaktree paid\n$141.5 million\n, or $388 per square foot, for a majority stake in the former Pruneyard office campus, partially owned by Ellis, next to the Pruneyard Shopping Center.\n\nAt the same time, Ellis and Fortress Investment Group spun off the 258,000-square-foot shopping center for\n$212.5 million\nand a 169-room Doubletree by\nHilton\nhotel next door for\n$59.1 million\n.\nIn 2014, Ellis and Fortress had bought the entire 27-acre Pruneyard office, retail and hotel shebang for\n$280 million\n.\nPSAI Realty Partners, co-founded by Peter Sullivan in 2006, has invested heavily throughout the Bay Area, but lacks an official website. In 2020, it was officially renamed PSAI Realty Partners IV, according to state business records, now managed by Sullivan, Michael Feldman and Erik Foraker.\nIn October PSAI Realty bought a 362,400-square-foot office complex in Walnut Creek for\n$167 million, or $477 per square foot\n, a premium price for the Bay Area.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Online payments company Stripe is expanding its Chicago footprint, signing a deal to double its office space at 350 North Orleans Street and extend its lease until 2031, a crucial victory for the distressed building as its landlord prepares to hand the keys over to its lender.\nThe move signals long-term growth for the fintech firm, even as its landlord, Blackstone,\nfaces foreclosure\non the building.\nSan Francisco–based Stripe will add more than 44,000 square feet to its existing lease, Crain’s\nreported\n, bringing its total footprint in the River North tower to nearly 89,000 square feet.\nThe property was put up for sale by its lender’s special servicer last year but failed to attract a buyer. Now, as KeyBank manages the foreclosure process, Stripe’s lease renewal could give the building a much-needed boost in occupancy.\nWhile many landlords have opted to offload struggling properties at steep discounts, some — like KeyBank — are investing in tenant retention to stabilize assets before selling. Stripe’s real estate play suggests some firms still see value in committing to downtown office space, even as broader market uncertainty lingers.\nStripe’s expansion bucks the city’s broader office downsizing trend, which saw downtown Chicago shed 1.6 million square feet of tenant space in 2024.\n\nOther commercial tenants have recently leveraged softened demand by expanding office space, including New York-based investment firm Blue Owl Capital, which\ndoubled its footprint\n, adding 27,000 square feet to its lease in a West Loop office tower at 150 North Riverside Plaza. Law firm Goldman Ismail Tomaselli Brennan &amp; Baum also\nleased 43,000 square feet\nthis week at 191 North Wacker Drive.\nBut the deal comes as 350 North Orleans Street faces financial hardship — Blackstone defaulted on a $310 million loan tied to the property, leading to a foreclosure lawsuit filed by Goldman Sachs in late February.\nThe private equity giant had already written down its investment in the building to zero, citing rising interest rates and a struggling downtown office market.\nThe 1.3 million-square-foot building, which was 65 percent leased as of late 2023, has been in distress as Chicago’s downtown vacancy rate persists at a record 26.3 percent, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of rising vacancies.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "The Bascom Group has picked up a 257-unit apartment complex in Rancho Palos Verdes for $127 million, with plans to renovate its 53-year-old interiors.\nThe Irvine-based private equity firm bought the Highridge Apartments at 28125 Peacock Ridge Drive, from Essex Property Trust, based in San Mateo,\nCommercial Observer reported\n.\nThe deal works out to $494,163 per unit.\nBrokers Blake Rogers and Kevin Sheehan of JLL represented the seller. JLL brokers Annie Rice and Jamie Kline arranged a loan for the buyer secured by the property from\nAXA Investment Managers for an undisclosed amount.\nThe apartment complex, built in 1972, is one of only three with over 100 units across Rancho Palos Verdes, according to Bascom, with units 21 percent larger than the average apartment in the city.\nThe firm said it plans to renovate the apartments and upgrade the complex to make it more “resort-style.” The estimated cost of the planned renovations was undisclosed.\nMonthly rents range from $2,250 for a studio to $4,245 for a three-bedroom apartment, some with ocean views, according to Apartments.com. The complex has two pools and spas, a tennis court and a 24-hour fitness center.\n“Highridge Apartments is located in a highly competitive market with one of the tightest vacancy rates in all of Los Angeles County,” Chad Sanderson, senior principal at Bascom, said in a statement.\n\nNine-figure deals for apartment complexes in the South Bay aren’t as common as in the north end of L.A., but such investments have been picking up, according to CO.\nIn January, North Carolina-based Bell Partners landed a\n$73 million refinancing loan\ntied to the  216-unit Bell South Bay Apartments in El Segundo.\nIn Torrance, Tokyo-based Koto Estate Company paid\n$71.5 million for The Highlands\n, a 121-unit property less than four miles northeast of Bascom’s new property in Rancho Palos Verdes.\nThe Bascom Group, founded in 1996 by Jerry Fink, David Kim and Derek Chen, has completed more than $21 billion in multifamily deals for more than 100,000 homes, plus more than $4 billion in commercial value-added transactions, according to its website.\nIn January 2024, Bascom and Realm Group\ndefaulted on a $32.9 million loan\nlinked to a development site for a 37-story, 422-unit residential tower at 675 South Bixel Street in downtown Los Angeles.\nIn November, Bascom sold a 406-unit apartment complex at 2414 North Tustin Avenue in Santa Ana for\n$129.2 million, or $318,227 per unit\n. Bascom bought the ninth-largest multifamily complex in the city in 2017 for $94 million, or $231,527 per unit.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",
