    "content": "A Houston-based developer delivered a condo highrise, London House, with nearly all of its units already sold, proving that luxury can go vertical in sprawling Texas metros.\nRandall Davis Company’s 12-story building at 2323 San Felipe Drive in River Oaks took two years to construct, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe 70,000-square-foot development has 23 units, including four penthouses. Prices range from $1.5 million to $3.8 million. Only two units are still available, according to company founder Randall Davis, who developed the project alongside his daughter, Natalie Davis.\nAll of the units have gas fireplaces, high-end appliances and cabinetry, 11- to 13-foot ceilings and customizable stone, porcelain and wood finishes. The building also includes a concierge-staffed lobby, resident lounge, dog run and pet-washing station. A four-story garage offers space for rent.\nA few luxury condo developers are catering to\ngrowing demand\nfor high-rise living across the Texas Triangle, where sprawl means luxury buyers have historically looked for luxury real estate with land.\n\nDavis is targeting buyers who are drawn to small buildings with top-notch amenities, he said.\nHis next project, The Chaucer, is also 12 stories, set to start construction soon at 2360 Rice Boulevard near Rice Village. The art deco-inspired development will have 29 units and span 75,000 square feet, with a third of units already pre-sold. The Chaucer will feature a brass-accented façade, concierge-staffed lobby, dog park and storage.\nThe highest tier of the luxury market in Houston has shown resilience, with home sales over $10 million surging by 75 percent to seven million homes in 2023. Affluent neighborhoods like River Oaks and Memorial lead the market for most-expensive home sales. However, the overall luxury segment has faced challenges, with fewer high-end listings compared to previous years, and competition from Dallas, which outpaces other Texas metros at the highest pricing tier.\nOther luxury condos under construction in Houston include the St. Regis Residences, a 35-story development set to begin construction next year in the Upper Kirby district. The Ritz-Carlton Residences in the Woodlands will offer 111 units designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects.\n—Rachel Stone\n",

    "content": "Disclaimer: This is a worst-case scenario.\nYou’re a landlord, or a co-op or condo board, and you install UL-rated gas detectors above your building’s gas stoves and dryers by May 1, as required by\nLocal Law 157\n.\nBefore long, one starts beeping. A tenant calls 911 and, fearing an explosion, hangs up and leaves the apartment. The dispatcher can see the address but doesn’t know in which unit the alarm sounded. She sends the Fire Department to investigate the potential gas leak.\nThe FDNY arrives, but cannot figure out where the alarm came from. The tenant who called is unreachable. Twenty minutes pass. Because gas might be building up in a unit, creating the potential for an explosion, the FDNY shuts off gas to the entire building.\nThe tenant finally returns and lets firefighters into her unit. They open the windows, turn the stove knobs to the off position and tell the tenant to come back in an hour. Everything’s back to normal, right?\nWrong. Your building must pass a pressure test for gas service to be turned back on. On the first try, it fails. So you have plumbers pull every gas stove and dryer out from the wall, cap all the pipes, and run a second pressure test. Another fail.\nThe building is old, and the pipes have shifted or corroded over time. Somewhere, probably in several places, there are leaks. But where? No one knows.\nYou’re faced with two unpalatable options: re-pipe the entire building or re-wire it and go electric, like\nthis Yonkers complex is doing\n. Either way, the cost is well into the six figures for a small building, and millions for a larger one.\nFor a co-op, that can mean refinancing your mortgage and raising your dues. For a rent-stabilized building, there’s no way to recover the cost, because the state strangled the Major Capital Improvements program in 2019.\n\nWhatever solution you choose will take months, if not longer. Meanwhile, everyone is using hot plates, ordering in or demanding to be relocated.\nWhat we’re thinking about:\nSource-of-income discrimination was the most common source of housing discrimination complaints to the city’s Human Rights Commission last fiscal year, with\n554\n. But is the problem still “pervasive,” as City Limits claimed in\nthis story\nabout new City Council bills targeting the crime? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we’ve learned\n: Sublet specialist\nRuth Colp-Haber\nof Wharton Property Advisors has a block on the computer of her colleague/husband Eric to make sure he is not distracted by NCAA basketball during work hours.\nElsewhere…\nThe Atlantic Avenue rezoning — dubbed AAMUP — was approved by the City Planning Commission, which was a formality because it is an Adams administration initiative and the mayor appoints most of the commissioners.\nBut it’s a good opportunity to debate the issues that have plagued the city’s housing market, particularly the notion that rezoning for “luxury” (actually mixed-income) development makes the problem worse.\nThe Atlantic’s\nJacob Anbinder\nhas spent years trying to debunk the myth that “new luxury housing is the reason that former working- and middle-class neighborhoods in their cities have become fancy enclaves.”\n“Not only is it a simplistic analysis that absolves nearly anyone who isn’t a developer of responsibility for the problem,” he wrote, “but in portraying new housing as the proximate cause of gentrification, it exacerbates the very housing crisis it seeks to solve.”\nClosing time\n— Matthew Elo",

    "content": "Developers Jeff Shapack and Shawn Clark are a step closer to starting construction on a massive Fulton Market mixed-use project by closing in on a luxury hotel operator.\nGlobal Ambassador, an upstart five-star hotel brand with a 141-room Phoenix location, is nearing a deal to run the lodging component of Shapack Partners’ and CRG’s planned development at 170 North Green Street, according to people familiar with the deal.\nThe hotel could take space within a 40-story mixed-use building approved by the city for the site. The plans also include office, retail and apartments, but the developers may still end up further emphasizing one use while scaling back others as they and competitors with shovel-ready sites in Fulton Market vie for corporate tenants.\nA Global Ambassador arrangement isn’t closed, but if kept on track, it would add another high-end hotel option to Chicago’s hottest neighborhood for commercial real estate, which already includes a Nobu hotel as well as Soho House and the Hoxton.\nIts ultimate outcome will be determined in large part by the office market, which across the nation has become increasingly concentrated in high-end new buildings within transforming neighborhoods, such as Fulton Market.\nMeanwhile, the Shapack-CRG venture behind the 170 North Green plan is eagerly awaiting decisions by potential office tenants scouting development sites in the area, according to market sources. As are Sterling Bay and Related Midwest, which respectively have city-approved office tower plans at\n330 North Green Street\nand 725 West Randolph Street.\nThe logjam in the development market could be unlocked with a move to anchor one of those potential towers by a handful of firms in the financial, legal and consulting sectors considering Fulton Market office space, although commercial real estate decision-making has slowed this year as economic uncertainty ballooned, leasing brokers have said.\nThe Global Ambassador deal could also be put on hold should a major office deal take shape for 170 North Green that would require non-workspace uses to be whittled down, the sources said. It could also be accelerated, should an office user sign on for some of the space within the building allotted to office by the plans, thus adding more momentum to the development team’s search for financing. Some office tenants may prefer a building with an on-site hotel.\n\nThe 170 North Green site and Related Midwest’s on Randolph Street previously made shifts away from hospitality in plans submitted to the city. Related in 2023 pivoted\n725 West Randolph\nfrom a mixed-use hotel-and-apartments project into office to compete for potentially lucrative tenants seeking upscale workspace in buzzy Fulton Market.\nSince developers received city approval in 2022 to build at 170 North Green, it has proven tricky to fund as construction loans got tougher to nail down when interest rates elevated. In 2023 they received city permission to remove the hotel element and replace it with an additional 65,000 square feet of office space, public records show. Now, they’re again leaning into including lodging; they’re approved for 150 hotel rooms in the property.\nThey also turned the vacant 62,000-square-foot lot — which previously contained the Bridgford Foods building that they\nbought for $60 million\nand later demolished — into pickleball courts while waiting to start construction on the permanent development.\nThe building is also approved to include 275 apartments, with 20 percent of them set aside for households making 60 percent or less of the area median income, as well as 350,000 square feet of office space, in addition to some retail. It’s unclear whether a deal for the Global Ambassador, if finalized, would reduce the amount of space within the building planned for offices and apartments.\nShapack and CRG didn’t return requests for comment, and neither did the Global Ambassador.\nSecuring the hospitality business could add some allure in their search for a construction lender. It’s unclear if the project will also require an anchor office tenant to sign onto a lease in order to gain funding. The site is encumbered by a $31.3 million mortgage from Missouri-based Citizens Bank that was taken out by the developers to fund their purchase of the site in 2022. The developers’ goal is to replace that debt with a construction loan.\nGlobal Ambassador was started by restaurateur Sam Fox, who opened his first property in Phoenix in late 2023 to critical acclaim, after about a decade of plotting and building the development. If its potential Chicago location is anywhere close to similar, expect it to be swanky: the Phoenix property contains five restaurants, a spa that offers cryotherapy and room rates for an early June stay start at just under $500 a night before taxes, with the 2,000-square-foot presidential suite available for about $3,400, the property’s website said.\nShould CRG and Shapack Partners start construction at 170 North Green, it would be the second major Fulton Market project they’ve kicked off in recent memory, after another joint venture of the firms landed an\n$84 million construction loan\nfor a 29-story, 308-unit apartment building at 220 North Ada Street last year. That project’s total reported cost is $140 million.\n",

    "content": "For one glorious week last June, the city opened a rent-voucher portal that had been closed for 15 years.\nThrough the magic door rushed 600,000 New Yorkers applying for Section 8, which comes from the federal government and is distributed by the New York City Housing Authority. NYCHA gets the money from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and forwards it to landlords. But first, it has to award Housing Choice Vouchers to tenants.\nFrom those applicants, NYCHA selected 200,000 by lottery. Cue the politicians.\nMayor Eric Adams, in a\npress release\n, touted the “much-needed relief to families searching for affordable housing.” And then-Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer said it “will be a lifeline to 200,000 New Yorkers who need affordable housing.”\nThese statements were a stretch, to say the least.\nNo, 200,000 New Yorkers did not get a lifeline. They got on a waiting list to get a lifeline.\nAnd the lifeline has no apartment on the other end of it. Tenants have\n180 days\nto find a unit eligible for the voucher and a willing landlord — not easy in a city with a\n1.4 percent vacancy rate\n.\nNow, the punchline: Nine months after the application window closed, NYCHA has worked its way through 12,000 applications and only 318 have succeeded. In a city with nearly 6 million renters, 318 is the statistical equivalent of zero.\nThe numbers are mind-boggling. Only 1 of every 45 tenants handed a voucher has rented an apartment with it. At its current pace, NYCHA will take nine more years to get through the 188,000 people on the waitlist. Last time it took 15 years.\nWhat are the lessons here? Besides not trusting quotes from politicians, that is.\n\nOne takeaway is that the ongoing battles over vouchers are a sideshow if the programs don’t get people into apartments and money in landlords’ pockets.\nThe City Council is fighting the Adams administration for more CityPHEPS vouchers, and New York City landlord and tenant groups are doing the same in Albany for state vouchers. More efficiency should be at least as high of a priority.\nThe New York Apartment Association has made this point often, but the process remains tedious, overly bureaucratic and often arbitrary. A tenant could beat the deadline, only to have an inspector reject the apartment for some picayune reason. Hello, homeless shelter.\nAn even more overlooked lesson is that the\nvacancy rate is too low\nfor vouchers to achieve their potential. City lawmakers have not done enough to increase the supply of multifamily housing, and state legislators have done virtually nothing.\nA final point: State law should be changed to allow the full value of vouchers to be used at rent-stabilized apartments. Right now, the “legal rent” is the maximum the landlord can receive, even if the voucher is worth more.\nThis means, for Section 8, New York is leaving federal money on the table, even as our politicians complain about Congress and the Trump administration cutting Medicaid and other funding (this\n$80 million\n, for example).\nTenants with Housing Choice Vouchers don’t make much money. The income threshold for an individual is $54,350 a year and $69,900 for a family of three.\nLetting them use their vouchers in full would give them a huge advantage over non-voucher holders (who are typically wealthier) in securing rent-stabilized units, which are about half of all rental units in the city. For probably the only time in their lives, they could actually outbid rich people.\nThis would make rent stabilization more like an affordable housing program, boost revenue at buildings that desperately need it for operating expenses and repairs and steer higher earners into market-rate units, where they belong.\nSome groups purportedly advocating for tenants oppose any change to this rule. They don’t want landlords to get more money. There is no obvious policy rationale except to force more buildings into foreclosure.\n",

    "content": "The City of San Jose dished out sweeteners to attract developers for housing, and Hanover Company took the bait.\nThe city waived $4.9 million fees and taxes for the Houston-based developer to build a 345-unit apartment complex at 905 North Capitol Avenue, in north San Jose,\nthe San Jose Mercury News reported\n.\nWithout the waiver of in-lieu fees and 50 percent reduction of construction taxes\napproved by the city last year\n, the seven-story project would have never gotten off the ground, officials say.\n“It’s a great thing all around, but I think it comes with the recognition that we have to be able to right size our fees and processes and regulations and figure out how to be flexible and meet the market and allow that investment to flow,” San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan told the newspaper.\nPlans by Hanover include 345 apartments, of which 328 units would be market-rate and 17 affordable for moderate-income households on a 2.1-acre site near the Penitencia Creek Light Rail Station. The building will contain 3,000 square feet of offices.\nScott Youdall, a regional development partner at Hanover, credited the city’s program with helping move the project along after it was approved three years ago.\n“When this project was originally entitled and approved, in the face of rising interest rates, we had not been able to get this project capitalized and started, but with the help of this incentive, we have been able to put the capitalization in place,” Youdall told the Mercury News.\nRising interest rates and higher labor and material costs have curtailed office and market-rate projects over the past few years, leading San Jose to dangle more incentives.\n\nMarket conditions have especially hindered multifamily development.\nAfter averaging one new multifamily development per year, the city didn’t see a single apartment project of more than 20 units break ground last year.\nTo help spur housing development, the city approved the new multifamily incentive program in December.\nThe initiative reduces park fees and a 50 percent cut in construction taxes for the first 1,500 units for projects in certain growth areas that applied by June 2022 and received building permits until the end of this year. A city analysis found that 35 projects qualified for incentives.\nHanover, founded by Murray Bowden in 1982, has developed multifamily residential and industrial properties in 12 states, including more than 56,000 apartments and $12 billion in project capitalization, according to its website.\nLast month, Hanover landed a\n$120.4 million construction financing\nto build 1,140 apartments\natop a historic persimmon orchard\nin north San Jose. It’s not clear if the city incentives applied to plans to redevelop the Tsukuda Fruit Stand and orchard at 2620 Seely Avenue.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Shopoff Realty Investments has paid $60 million for two industrial buildings in Buena Park, which it plans to redevelop into homes.\nThe Irvine-based developer bought the 370,000-square-foot office and warehouse campus at 5600 Beach Boulevard, the\nLos Angeles Times\nand\nOrange County Business Journal\nreported.\nThe seller was Amway, a nutrition supplement company based in Michigan. The deal for the nearly 14-acre property works out to $162 per square foot, or $4.3 million per acre.\nShopoff secured a $49 million loan from an unidentified lender to buy the site. The loan was arranged by JLL.\nAmway agreed to lease back the building to the company’s Nutrilite division, used for teaching and training, while Shopoff moves forward with plans to replace the buildings with townhomes in a partnership with Miami-based Lennar Homes.\nThe property, not far from the Buena Park train station, may be a premium site for redevelopment.\n\n“Buena Park offers a tremendous opportunity for strategic redevelopment,” said William Shopoff, CEO of Shopoff Realty. “This acquisition allows us to capitalize on a prime Orange County location with significant accessibility and strong demand for new housing options.”\nLast month, Shopoff Realty scored a\n$60.9 million loan\nto build 250 homes and a 215-room boutique hotel atop a former oil tank farm in Huntington Beach.\nThe developer plans to break ground this year on Magnolia Coast, the hotel-retail village with 19,000 square feet of shops and restaurants on 29 acres west of Magnolia Street and north of the Huntington Beach Channel, some 2,000 feet from the beach.\nShopoff’s eponymous firm, which he founded in 1992, had $3 billion in assets under management at the end of 2023, with $477 million in property sales and financing, according to the Business Journal.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "It’s no secret among San Francisco developers that landing a building permit can take years — making it the slowest city in the state to build anything.\nSupervisor Bilal Mahmood, who recently replaced antidevelopment Supervisor Dean Preston, has now called for a city investigation into what’s taking so long to hand out permits,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nMahmood planned to ask the supervisors’ budget and legislative analyst this week to study the permitting process in five other cities across the state and compare them to San Francisco.\nThe study would look into the number and types of permits required by other major cities and counties that allow everything from small businesses and single-family homes to large housing projects to be built more quickly.\nIt would also analyze every step in San Francisco’s permitting gauntlet, and the time it takes its various departments to spit out the permits. A timeline for the proposed study was not disclosed.\n“There are over 1,000 pages of San Francisco building code that have resulted in us being the slowest city to build in the entire state,” Mahmood told the Chronicle. “There are other cities in the Bay Area and across California that are building faster than us with the same interest rates, the same labor conditions, the same costs.”\nSan Francisco must permit 82,000 homes by 2031, more than half of them affordable, according to the state-mandated housing plan. The city is now rezoning much of the city to meet the goal.\n\nMahmood’s request for a new study aims to support the goals of PermitSF, an initiative by Planning Director Rich Hillis and Mayor Daniel Lurie to reform the city’s housing and small business permitting process.\n“This effort to learn from other cities who are building faster than us is consistent with the goals of PermitSF to deliver bold, transformative permitting solutions to accelerate the construction of much-needed housing in San Francisco,” Hillis told the Chronicle.\nIt’s not clear why it has taken San Francisco so long to evaluate its\nglacial permitting process\n.\nIn 2023, the city greenlit the building of 1,136 homes, a 13-year-low, according to figures from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. That compares to an average of 2,476 permits a year since 2001, with a peak 5,200 permits doled out in 2018, according to the San Francisco Business Times.\nA year earlier,\nThe Real Deal reported\nit took nearly 1,000 days on average -– 450 days for entitlements and another 525 days for permitting –– to get cleared to start a residential project in San Francisco, according to the state Department of Housing and Community Development.\nA\nSan Francisco Chronicle analysis\nfound it took the city an average 627 days to permit an apartment project, and 861 days to permit a single-family home.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Bruce Beal, Jr. is striking out on his own away from his boss Stephen Ross — in the professional sports realm, at least.\nBeal is part of the investment group that agreed to buy the Boston Celtics for $6.1 billion, Sportico\nreported\n. The Related Companies president is not the primary investor in the deal; that distinction belongs to Symphony Technology Group managing partner William Chisholm.\nIn addition to Beal, the pending ownership group also includes Rob Hale, who was already an investor in the NBA franchise. Private equity fund Sixth Street committed more than $1 billion as an equity partner; it’s unclear what stake Beal will have in the franchise.\nThe Grousbeck family announced last July that it would be putting the Celtics up for sale, shortly after the team secured its 18th NBA title. The family purchased the team in 2002 for $360 million; the $6.1 billion sale would represent a record price, not just in the NBA, but across American professional sports.\n\nThe deal is expected to unfold in two stages. The Grousbecks are expected to sell a majority of the team immediately upon receiving approval from the league and its owners, then the rest of the team in 2028. Wyc Grousbeck is expected to remain in control of the franchise through the 2027-28 season.\nIn addition to Related, Beal is the vice chair and partner of the NFL’s Miami Dolphins, which are owned by Ross. A succession plan laid out in 2016 and approved by the other owners in the league gave Beal the first shot at purchasing the Dolphins, should Ross sell or die.\nBut a few years ago, Ross\ncalled an audible\n, deciding to leave the team for his daughter, Jennifer, instead. The change of plans came to light shortly after the NFL\npenalized Ross and Beal\nfor violating the league’s anti-tampering policies in their efforts to recruit Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady and New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton, though the shift appeared to be unrelated.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "One of the nation’s biggest construction lenders has given Nick Marietti the fuel he needs to start construction on a suburban Chicago rental project.\nMarietti’s Schaumburg-based firm VennPoint Real Estate closed on $55 million in financing, led by Bank OZK’s nearly $46 million construction loan, for the 144-unit townhome project slated for Five Parkway North Boulevard in Deerfield, according to a news release.\nThe developer scored the remaining $9.9 million in funding from an undisclosed insurance company in the form of a mezzanine loan.\nThe deal underscores growing interest in suburban Chicago townhome developments. Chicago-based JDI Realty last year spent $34 million on buying up a portfolio of 164 townhomes throughout Chicago’s surroundings that the seller had built up over 14 years.\nVennPoint purchased the approximately 10 acres targeted for construction for $10.2 million, from its previous owner, Deerfield-based Quadrangle, which spent a little more than $5.8 million to buy the land in 2015, public record show. The development site is adjacent to a multi-building corporate office complex that includes the 258,000-square-foot\nOne Parkway North\nbuilding, whose landlord Joseph Horn is in default on a $12.7 million loan.\n\nThe residential development is dubbed Park5 and will include two- and three-bedroom layouts averaging a little more than 1,900 square feet each, with two-car attached garages and private yards and outdoor space — rarities for traditional multifamily rentals.\nVennPoint’s plan is to set aside 14 units as affordable to comply with Deerfield’s housing regulations, it told public officials in October. Its original plan was to build 147 units, but it scaled that slightly back to 144. The financing pencils out to $382,000 per unit.\nJLL’s Matthew Schoenfeldt and Mary Dooley represented VennPoint in its deal for the construction debt. JLL’s Dan Reynolds and Chris Cummins advised the land seller Quadrangle.\nThe project is one of several rental developments coming to Deerfield. Wisconsin-based Continental Properties last year raked in a $54 million construction loan to pursue a 254-unit rental project, with 25 units designated as affordable, near Interstate 94 and South Waukegan Road. Separately, Chicago-based Celadon Partners is kicking off a $70 million plan to replace an office complex at 1101 Lake Cook Road with an affordable senior housing community.\n",

The sale price is about the same as what GBT paid for the 3.7-acre site in 2021, the outlet said.\nOracle’s acquisition further cements its commitment to Nashville, where it made waves in 2021 with a $253.7 million purchase of over 65 acres for its future riverfront campus. Its latest acquisition is between the planned HQ site and the Landings at River North, MRP Realty’s $220 million mixed-use project delivered in 2023. The River North district has been transformed through decades of strategic acquisitions by developer Don Allen, who sold parcels to Oracle, GBT and MRP Realty for a combined $333 million.\n\nDespite its significant land investments and receiving the largest economic development incentives in city and state history, construction on Oracle’s $1.35 billion campus has yet to commence, with no start date announced. Its ambitious plans include making Nashville a major employment hub, with incentives tied to bringing 8,500 jobs to the city by 2031.\nOracle’s expansion extends beyond land acquisitions. The company recently increased its downtown office space by 60,000 square feet,\nsubleasing\ntwo floors in a Capitol View office complex from HealthStream, bringing its total Nashville office presence to over 200,000 square feet.\nOracle Chairman Larry Ellison designated the future East Bank campus as the company’s global headquarters last year, tapping architect Norman Foster to design the project on 70 acres Oracle purchased for $277 million.\n—Rachel Stone\n",

    "content": "Miami architect Kobi Karp pulled off a double play, scoring a green light on designs for a pair of apartment projects near Edgewater  and Wynwood Norte.\nOn Wednesday, the\nMiami Urban Development Review Board\napproved 1600 Edgewater, Sabet Group’s 33-story tower with 282 apartments, as well as Evolve Companies’ Evolve Wynwood 35, an eight-story building with 141 rental units.\nBoth projects are redevelopment plays by out-of-state builders that entered the Miami market in 2022. The review board approved 1600 Edgewater and Evolve Wynwood 35 unanimously, and suggested a few minor design tweaks for both projects.\n1600 Edgewater\nLos Angeles and New-York-based Sabet Group, led by Andre and Edward Sabetfard, is developing 1600 Edgewater. The firm planted its flag in South Florida three years ago when Sabet acquired the 0.5-acre site at 1600 Northeast Second Avenue for\n$14.3 million\n. The property is in Miami’s\nArts &amp; Entertainment District\n, but borders\nEdgewater\n.\nThe property is currently home to a single-story commercial building leased to a go-kart amusement company. The site is zoned for a 25-story apartment building with a maximum of 250 units, but Sabet obtained city approval for a height and unit increase through public benefits bonuses by setting aside 20 apartments for affordable housing.\n\nKarp designed the building with an eight-floor parking podium with 352 parking spaces. The planned tower will also have 9,519 square feet of retail, including a rooftop restaurant, plans show.\nEvolve Wynwood 35\nIn 2022, Evolve Companies, led by Joe McKinney and Mike Winstead Jr. entered the Miami market by dropping\n$9.8 million\nfor six lots with small single-family houses and apartment buildings at 543, 553, 579, 583, 585 and 535-539 Northwest 35th Street in Wynwood Norte.\nThe Greensboro, North Carolina-based firm tapped Karp to design Evolve Wynwood 35, which will replace the older building and homes, which were completed between 1926 and 1951. Featuring a facade painted in various colors by different artists, Wynwood 35 will also include a parking garage on the first, second and third floors with 202 spaces.\nSince 2013, Evolve has focused on multifamily and student housing projects, as well as providing construction management services, according to the firm’s website. The company has more than $1 billion in assets under management with a portfolio spanning 25 million square feet and 20,000 units.\nEvolve is also planning a second project, an 11-story building with 105 apartments, in\nWynwood Norte\n. In 2022, the firm also paid\n$9 million\nfor a 0.7-acre site at 475 Northwest 36th Street.",

    "content": "Jay Paul Company has a new plan for its CityView development in downtown San Jose, swapping out some office buildings for an office-to-resi conversion, a brand new residential tower and retail.\n“Demand for older Class B and C office space at this site has declined, while the need for housing in San Jose continues to grow,” Paul told The Real Deal. “Right now, multifamily development is delivering stronger returns than aging office properties, making residential conversion an attractive proposition.”\nThe new design redevelops San Jose’s CityView Plaza, which the Silicon Valley developer bought the bulk of for $283.5 million in 2018, adding two adjacent properties a year later for $100 million. That same year, the firm also bought the 19-story 50 West San Fernando Street for $238 million, bringing its holdings to about $680 million in downtown San Jose.\nOriginally plans called for three 19-story, interconnected office towers containing 3.4 million square feet of offices, shops and restaurants. The company\nasked the city for a five-year pause\non that plan last year, citing “current financial markets and a reduced demand for office leasing.”\nNow downtown San Jose’s biggest office owner is moving forward, but with a new plan for a mixed-use community with a large residential component, plus office, retail and restaurants, according to a news release from the company.\n“We’re long-term owners of the property, and unlike short-term investors or fee-driven developers, our low basis in the property allows us to take a strategic, sustainable approach ensuring solid returns,” Paul said.\nThe Village at CityView is a 320-unit conversion of an existing four-building office campus, as well as the current 2.35-acre plaza, designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz. Apartment units will range from studios to three-bedrooms, with shared green spaces, a 10,000-square-foot fitness and wellness center, and a rooftop pool, “all of which enhance downtown San Jose’s appeal as a vibrant place to call home,” the release indicates.\n\nPhase two of the project details a brand-new 27-story luxury apartment tower, called The Tower at CityView, at 121 South Market Street. Also designed by SCB, it will have 360 units, from studios to three-bedroom penthouses, with rooftop lounges and outdoor terraces showcasing city views, along with onsite, underground parking.\nFor the retail component, The Shops at CityView will bring 35,000 square feet of retail and restaurants designed by architect DES to a “downtown environment that currently lacks similar amenities,” the release says. Set to be located at the intersection of Park Avenue and Almaden Boulevard, the retail hub will “complement” the existing 15,000 square feet of street level retail in Jay Paul Company’s adjacent\n19-story 200 Park\n, which houses Adobe World Headquarters, and the Center for the Performing Arts.\nThere is still a substantial office component in CityView proper with the extensive renovation of 150 Almaden, a 15-story, 204,000-square-foot Class A office building that will be “modernized to meet the evolving needs of today’s high-tech workforce,” according to the release. The renovation will include an upgrade to the building systems, a new lobby and tenant amenities like a conference center and fitness center. Like 200 Park, it will have three parking spots for every 1,000 square feet, which the company said would allow it to “compete with the convenience of suburban projects while offering a dynamic and exciting location in the heart of downtown.”\n“People want to live, work and play in the safest big city in the Bay,” San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan said in a statement, calling the project “groundbreaking” for its ability to help the city “reimagine what the capital of Silicon Valley looks and feels like in the age of AI.”\nPaul said that the mayor had made it clear that housing is integral to downtown’s future, with an eye towards a “dynamic, experience-driven economy,” and that Mahan and the city council had “stepped up with new initiatives to support downtown investors, enhance safety, and streamline the development process.” He also said that creating vibrancy downtown would benefit the company’s existing office properties, like 200 Park across the street.\n“Downtown San Jose has made a strong comeback,” he said, citing improved foot traffic and nightlife. “Adding more housing will only strengthen the momentum, supporting a 24/7 economy and bringing even more people to the area.”\n",

They include Banner starting demolition at the site no later than June 24, with completion expected by early August.\nBuildings like the Egg Harbor Cafe on Hale Street may remain intact, contingent on tenant operations, despite surrounding structures being boarded up in preparation for demolition.\n\nThe project has garnered mixed reactions from the community and local leaders. Former council member Scott Brown praised the investment potential but acknowledged they’ve faced market challenges as construction loans have become more difficult to secure for developers since interest rates took off in 2022.\nBanner Real Estate has already submitted demolition applications ahead of the April 24 deadline. Additionally, a substantial payment of $250,000 to acquire a public alley crucial for the project’s footprint has been scheduled upon demolition permit issuance.\nThe suburban Chicago multifamily market is experiencing strong rental demand, with rents rising 4.4 percent year-over-year, outpacing the city core. Despite challenges from elevated interest rates, the suburbs have become attractive for investors due to tax stability and limited new supply, leading to a competitive market.\n— Sam Lounsberry\n",

The property’s occupancy dipped from 94 percent at the end of 2022 to 88 percent last June.\nNord Group bought the garden-style multifamily property, at 10300 Wilcrest Drive, in 2021. It was built in 1979 and is located in the southwest Houston suburb of Alief, about 16 miles from downtown. The property’s taxable value was set at $32.4 million million last year, appraisal district records show.\nNord Group was founded in 2018 and said it got swept up in the multifamily bubble of the pandemic that burst when interest rates surged and valuations plunged.\n\nTwo principals at Nord Group, Khaled Noor and Baruch Teitelbaum, were majority interest holders in three ownership LLCs that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late last year, Bisnow\nreported\nin December.\nThe LLCs owned three Houston apartment complexes totaling 618 units: The Avenue, a 215-unit property at 5050 Yale Street; Toro Place, a 320-unit property at 12101 Fondren Road; and Miramar Townhomes, a 48-unit property at 2380 Bering Drive.\nThe debtors blamed their Houston-based management company Better World Properties for botching renovations.\nThey also said in the filing that they were “inexperienced and unfamiliar” with multifamily commercial real estate.\nHouston’s multifamily market has absorbed a glut of deliveries in the last three years, driving occupancy and rental rates down. The numbers were stabilizing heading into this year — with occupancy at 88.6 at the end of last year, up slightly from its position at the end of 2023, 88.5 percent —  but some inexperienced operators like Nord Group have struggled to survive the cycle.\n",

    "content": "A long-neglected state-owned site in Brooklyn that has sat in redevelopment limbo for decades is once again up for grabs.\nGov. Kathy Hochul issued a request for proposals on Thursday for 1024 Fulton Street, seeking a developer to take over the 12,800-square-foot Clinton Hill site. The request comes with conditions: The new owner must build apartments where all rents are at or below 100 percent of the area median income, and the new building must include at least 100 units. The RFP also calls for a community center on the building’s ground floor.\nWhoever is selected to take over the site will pay a nominal fee. The state may still opt to create a ground lease on the site rather than handing over full ownership of the property.\nPlans to redevelop the site have been snarled up in attempts to transfer the property to a nonprofit.\nIn 2014, the Cuomo administration halted plans to auction the site at the urging of then-Assembly member Walter Mosley, who wanted to sell the property to the nonprofit Northeast Brooklyn Housing Development Corp.,\nthe New York Daily News reported at the time\n. When that plan fell apart, the state legislature\napproved a bill\nin 2020 to sell the property to Philadelphia-based TCH Holdings for “fair market value.”\nThat proposal also didn’t come to fruition because TCH didn’t file the required paperwork outlining its plan for a senior center on the site,\nThe City reported\n.\n\nThe latest RFP requires that the development team be 51 percent owned by a nonprofit, and it gives a slight edge to those wholly owned by a nonprofit (five points out of a maximum of 100 a bidder can earn based on criteria outlined by the state).\nThe state budget for fiscal year 2024-2025 allocated $3.7 million to demolish the 33,000-square-foot vacant building on the site. The building served as a showroom for Brooklyn Union Gas in 1912 and then for manufacturing and commercial uses.\nThe state’s Office of Children and Family Services bought the property in 1997, hoping to develop a community center. However, “due to structural issues,” the agency abandoned that plan, according to the RFP. The building has since sat vacant.\nThe site’s current zoning allows residential space that is four times the size of the lot (or a floor area ratio of 4), with a maximum building height of 85 feet. If a building includes affordable housing, the FAR can go up to 5 and the height to 115 feet. The RFP notes that the state is willing to override local zoning to maximize the amount of affordable housing, and will consider additional density, height and other modifications if they “support a superior design and site plan while being cost-effective.”\nThe RFP for the Fulton Street site is the latest effort by the Hochul administration to build on state-owned land. The\nstate budget last year\ncreated a capital fund to build more than 15,000 homes on state-owned properties.\n",

    "content": "A South Side landlord is testing how buzzy Bronzeville has become by listing two apartment buildings for $225,000 per unit.\nRaphael Lowenstiein, who previously landed in financial hot water from racking up code violations on other South Side properties, is putting two apartment buildings at 4201 and 4750 South Michigan Avenue up for sale together or separately. If the combined 45 units sold at the target price of $10.1 million, the sale would be on par with recent multifamily sales in more established real estate markets in Chicago. The properties do not have outstanding code violations.\nAssets snagging between $200,000 and $300,000 in the past year include a 17-unit complex sold in Avondale, which sold for $235,000 per unit last May; a 47-unit complex in river West that\nsold for $302,000 per unit\nthe following month; and in the West Loop,\na 274-unit tower that sold for $278,000 per unit\nin October.\nBronzeville had been experiencing a dramatic decline in population until recently, much like other areas of the South Side.\nThe neighborhood was a hub for Black population growth during the Great Migration in the early to mid-1900s, but years of disinvestment led its population to decline by more than 75 percent between 1950 and 2000, according to United Way of Metro Chicago.\nGrowth in nearby Hyde Park and the expected 2026 completion of t\nhe Obama presidential library\nin Woodlawn has spurred an influx of interest recently, along with Farpoint Development’s planned\n$3.2 billion megadevelopmen\nt known as Bronzeville Lakefront.\nOn the residential side, a single family home in\nWoodlawn set a record this month\n, selling for $1.2 million, which was $400,000 more than any previous home sold in the neighborhood.\n“From the 7100 block up to Douglas, it’s all improved significantly,” said SVN’s Joe Connelly, who is listing agent for Lowenstein’s South Michigan Avenue properties. “In Woodlawn, I was working on a deal for $200,000 a door. That would have been absolutely unheard of even four years ago.”\n\nA sale at or above $200,000 per unit is not a guarantee, even with the area’s growth. A two-building Hyde Park portfolio at 5111 South University Avenue and 5135 South Blackstone Avenue totaling 77 studio and one-bedroom units sold this month for $103,000 per unit.\nBut the South Michigan Avenue properties also benefit from their proximity to Bronzeville Lakefront and from larger-than-typical floorplans because they were converted from condos and renovated, Connelly said.\n“Local investors think the price per door is a little steep for Bronzeville, but it reflects the rents that they’re achieving,” Connelly said.\nAverage rents are close to $2,000 per unit, and the average average unit size is about 1,315 square feet, Connelly said. Some duplex units have 2,400-square-foot floorplans, he said.\nIt hasn’t been smooth sailing for the buildings’ owners. Raphael Lowenstein, who leads property management firm 312 Properties with his brother Ari Lowenstein, have been accused of allowing other properties they run to rack up code violations and leave tenants living in poor conditions.\nThe code violations at properties at 4520 and 4830 South Drexel Boulevard and 4612-4626 South Lake Park Avenue\nnearly led the landlords to default\non $54 million worth of CMBS loans backing the properties but they later cleared the violations and\nsecured new financing\n.\nRaphael Lowenstein did not respond to requests for comment.\n",

    "content": "Miami Beach commissioners approved land use changes that will allow the Meruelo family and David Martin’s Terra to build a larger project on the oceanfront property that was previously home to the Deauville Beach Resort.\nThe commission on Wednesday evening voted six to 1, with commissioner David Suarez casting the sole ‘no’ vote, on first reading to approve two amendments that would apply to the 3.8-acre oceanfront property at 6701 Collins Avenue in North Beach. Mayor Steven Meiner and commissioners Tanya Bhatt, Laura Dominguez, Alex Fernandez, Joseph Magazine and Kristen Rosen Gonzalez voted in favor.\nMartin, CEO of Terra, has been leading the charge on behalf of the Meruelos, who have a 75 percent stake in the property. Martin was brought on in part due to his reputation as a developer who negotiates successfully with local governments, helping\nwith damage control\n.\nThe Meruelo family and Terra now plan a 120-unit condo and 150-room hotel project on the site, designed by Foster + Partners, Shulman + Associates and ODP as the project architect.\nThe\nDeauville\nproperty currently has a floor area ratio, or overall project size, of 3.0 to 3.15. The developer is seeking legislative changes that would allow for an FAR of 5.5, for a project that could span nearly 916,000 square feet. The project would include a partial reconstruction of the Deauville and a proposed height of 400 feet tall.\nThe changes will require a referral to the planning board and a second reading vote from the commission, likely next month.\nThe Meruelos were heavily criticized for letting the iconic Deauville fall into disrepair to the point where it required demolition. The family has also been tied up in litigation with the city.\nThose sentiments weren’t on display for the majority of the discussion at Wednesday’s commission meeting. Residents and city officials spoke overwhelmingly in favor of the redevelopment.\n“I want to speak to you from my heart when I tell you that this project is brilliant, and Mr. Martin, the time he has spent listening, public hearings, answering questions, I think the humanity of it is also brilliant for such a big project,” said Richard Zaki, a resident at the nearby Sterling condo building.\nElizabeth Latone, who is on the city’s planning board, spoke as a member of the public, begging the commission to approve the project.\n\n“How much longer can we wait? At what point is something going to be good enough for this spot? Yes, we have terrible owners. Everybody knows that they are toxic, but we can’t wait anymore,” Latone said.\nCommissioner Bhatt agreed.\n“I hate the fact that they’re going to make money off of this,” she said, referring to the Meruelos. Bhatt said the city was nearing a deal to have the owners pay off millions of dollars in fines they owe the city.\nDaniel Ciraldo, executive director of the Miami Design Preservation League, supported the project and praised its design, but urged the city to remember that the Meruelos own the majority interest and asked that they negotiate a lower height.\n“We need to make sure that we’re clear that the owners are also the Meruelos, and they owe millions of dollars to the city of Miami Beach, and David Martin is a very good developer, but there’s another owner that a lot of us know cannot always be trusted,” he said.\n“It is a double height of what was there,” he added. “Between first and second [reading], I hope you guys can really negotiate the height, make it even better.”\nThe Deauville, built in 1957, was about 185 feet tall and 17 stories.\nThis latest proposal follows billionaire developer Steve Ross’ plan to secure an FAR of 4.5, which voters\nrejected via a referendum\nin 2022. Ross entered into a contract with the Meruelos to pay $500 million for the site, but the deal was contingent on voters approving the referendum.\nIn a statement, Martin said the development team is “taking the time to get it right.” The project, he wrote, “will pay tribute to the legacy of the historic Deauville.” He joined the project about a year ago when Terra\npaid $12.5 million\nfor a 25 percent stake in the property.\n",

    "content": "Tenants at a Philadelphia apartment building are banding together to take the rare step of suing their landlord.\nResidents of the 71-unit Bentley Manor in West Oak Lane filed a class action lawsuit against Odin Properties and ownership entities tied to the company, WHYY\nreported\n. The lawsuit was filed last week in the Common Pleas Court.\nThe plaintiffs allege Odin collected rent despite the city’s Department of Licenses and Inspections labeling the property as an “unsafe structure,” citing loose and missing bricks, as well as a “leaning parapet” on the roof. The determination was made in November, after which Odin had 30 days to make repairs.\nIn Philadelphia, landlords are not allowed to collect rent if buildings are not compliant with safety and habitability standards. Odin is accused of failing to appeal the 30-day notice it received or make the necessary repairs, therefore forfeiting its right to collect rent.\nBut Odin continued collecting for four months, according to the lawsuit. The complaint demands Odin make the required repairs and return the unlawful rent paid to the landlord.\n\n“We care deeply about our residents and take tremendous pride in our relationships with them, so we take any allegations to the contrary very seriously,” Odin chief executive officer Philip Balderston said in a statement. “We are carefully considering the allegations of the recent complaint and plan to respond appropriately.”\nOdin did receive a commercial building permit two weeks ago, suggesting it may be about to make structural repairs to the property.\nOdin owns and manages more than 1,500 apartments in Philadelphia. It also has a history of receiving tenant complaints regarding living conditions. Last year, Renters United Philadelphia held a protest demanding the landlord make repairs at affordable apartments across its portfolio, an action that came after tenants petitioned for a rent and eviction freeze at all of Odin’s properties until repairs were made.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "Parkmerced has veered into receivership after Maximus Real Estate Partners defaulted on nearly $1.8 billion in loans secured by the largest apartment complex in San Francisco.\nA court appointed the San Diego-based Douglas Wilson Companies to serve as a receiver for the 152-acre, 3,221-unit complex at 3711 19th Avenue, south of San Francisco State University,\nthe San Francisco Business Times reported.\nMaximus and its lawyers are set to appear in court later in March to “give legal reason why a receiver should not be confirmed,” according to court records.\nThe court order came three months after the locally based Maximus defaulted on a $1.5 billion commercial mortgage-backed loan, according to the newspaper. It said the landlord was in talks\nwith lenders\nBarclays and Citigroup for months leading up to the December maturity default\nThe Real Deal\n, however, had reported in July that Maximus had\ndefaulted on $1.775 billion in loans\ntied to the blighted complex.\nIt was in 2019 that Maximus recapitalized $1.8 billion debt with $1.5 billion in senior financing from Barclays and Citi and a $275 million mezzanine loan from Aimco.\nMaximus had proposed redeveloping the World War II-era garden apartments by adding 5,700 homes, 230,000 square feet of shops and restaurants, 80,000 square feet of offices and a 64,000-square-foot community center.\nAlthough plans for its redevelopment were approved in 2011, and\nnew renderings put out\nin 2022, the project never broke ground, with Maximus founder Rob Rosania citing “sky-high construction costs, inflation and supply chain issues.”\n\nRosania said in December his firm was planning to close a loan extension in “coming weeks.” Notes sent to bondholders this month said future lender actions could include foreclosure.\nLast April, $1.8 billion in loans backed by Parkmerced were\nturned over to special servicing at the request of the landlord\n, citing high vacancy and a looming loan maturity.\nIn May, the\nSan Francisco Chronicle reported\ndozens of Parkmerced tenant complaints about broken elevators, lack of lighting in public areas, mold and mildew, leaks, car break-ins, rodents, overflowing dumpsters and squatters taking over vacant units.\nThe publication said the landlord may have cut back on security and maintenance, leading to\nrising crime and blight\n.\nParkmerced, a planned development from Metropolitan Life and designed by Leonard Schultze and Associates, opened its first apartments in 1944 for homecoming war veterans. It’s the second-largest complex in the state behind L.A.’s historic Park La Brea, another garden apartment complex with 4,225 units.\nDouglas Wilson, founder of his eponymously named company, said its goal will be to safeguard Parkmerced and work toward its “repositioning.”\n“It’s been lacking capital for some time,” Wilson told the Business Journal, adding his firm would address issues with life safety and spending. The company is considering bringing in a new property management firm.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "The housing market thawed out from a winter freeze in February, warmed up by rising supply.\nExisting home sales increased 4.2 percent in February from January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.26 million, according to a\nmonthly report\nfrom the National Association of Realtors. Despite the monthly gain, sales were down 1.2 percent compared to last February.\n“Home buyers are slowly entering the market,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement. “Mortgage rates have not changed much, but more inventory and choices are releasing pent-up housing demand.”\nThe median price for existing home sales rose to $398,400, a 3.8 percent increase from the same period in 2024 and the 20th consecutive month of year-over-year price increases. All four regions tracked recorded price gains.\nHousing inventory at the end of the month climbed to 1.24 million units, up 5.1 percent from January and 17 percent from one year ago. That represents a 3.5-month supply at the latest sales pace, unchanged from January but up from three months last February.\n\nRegional performance varied. The Northeast saw a 2 percent monthly decrease, but a 4.2 percent annual increase. Midwest sales remained unchanged from January but rose 1 percent from last year. The South experienced a 4.4 percent monthly increase despite being down 4 percent annually. And the West showed the strongest monthly growth at 13.3 percent, with sales remaining identical to a year ago.\nFirst-time buyers accounted for 31 percent of sales in February, up from 28 percent in January and 26 percent a year earlier. Cash sales represented 32 percent of transactions and individual investors purchased 16 percent of homes.\nProperties typically remained on the market for 42 days in February, slightly longer than both the previous month (41 days) and last February (38 days).\nZillow chief economist Skylar Olsen expects the “disappointing volume of existing home sales…to be short-lived” as homebuyers remain sensitive to mortgage rates in a time of vast economic uncertainty.\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.65 percent as of March 13, according to Freddie Mac, slightly up from the previous week but down from 6.74 percent one year ago.\n",

Two of the largest lots, at 25 acres and 10 acres, didn’t sell.\nPurchases broke down as follows:\nHaikal Exemption Trust, for which no information was immediately available, won three bids during the sale. The trust paid $1.5 million for 2.5 acres east of South Rainbow Boulevard and North Gomer; $1.7 million for 2.5 acres at Roban Avenue and South Las Vegas Boulevard; and $2.1 million for 5 acres east of the 215-Beltway at West Azure and North Hualapai Way.\nAtlanta-based Beazer Homes, an Atlanta-based home construction company, won bids for two adjacent 5-acre parcels east of South Racetrack between Burkholder Boulevard and Venice Avenue, for $1.7 million and $2 million.\nElite Excavating, based in Utah and Nevada, paid $3.7 million for 12.5 acres east of U.S. Highway 95 along Sun Village Park Drive and Kyle Canyon Road.\nHamid “Henry” Moradi paid $2.6 million for 6.85 acres off Blue Diamond Road between South Grand Canyon Drive and Hualapai Way.\nKhusrow Roohani, owner of locally based Seven Valleys Realty &amp; Construction, paid $1.2 million for 2.5 acres north of Blue Diamond Road along South Buffalo Drive and West Cougar Avenue.\nTwo parcels received no bids, including 10 acres at the southwest corner of West La Madre Way and North Fort Apache Road, with a fair market value of $4.3 million, and 25 acres east of the 215 Beltway, on the northern border of West Centennial. They may be reauctioned.\n\nIt’s not clear why 35 acres of available land didn’t sell.\nFunds from the BLM land auction will pay for recreational opportunities and wildland fire reduction, according to the agency. The BLM manages more than 245 million acres of public land, primarily in 12 western states.\nDevelopers in Las Vegas point to a local land crunch, with one builder saying 25,000 acres of land around Las Vegas Valley are available for development, with the region poised to run out of buildable land in as little as seven years,\naccording to the Review-Journal\n.\nHome builders at a Keller Williams’ Meet the Builders panel in March cited challenges to development, including the lack of land, high land costs, record residential real estate prices and high mortgage rates.\nThe BLM, which controls approximately 88 percent of the land in Clark County, is coming under increased pressure from the private sector to sell off dirt. Last month, Gov. Joe Lombardo pressured state legislators to issue a resolution urging the Department of the Interior to release land for housing.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "“Profit” is such a dirty word to some Americans it makes you wonder if they realize it has made the United States the richest nation in the world.\nWhich brings us to an astonishing rent control saga in Washington Heights.\nCovering a case pitting 78-year-old Freda Henderson against landlord Westside Ventura II LLC, Gothamist wrote, “Her lawyer said in a statement that the judge’s decision ensures Henderson can stay in her affordable home and protects her from the landlord’s goal of evicting her to maximize profits.”\n“This case is not just about one tenant,” said Patrick Tyrrell of Mobilization for Justice, who represented Henderson. “It is part of a pattern of landlords exploiting legal loopholes to erode rent protections and displace long-term residents.”\nWait a second. Exploiting loopholes? Eroding rent protections? Displacing residents?\nGiven the facts of the case, Tyrell’s characterizations look a lot like spin. And dissecting his argument helps debunk some common myths associated with rent control and the motivations underlying both landlords and tenants.\nLet’s start with his attack on profit. Setting aside whether the law entitles Henderson to a rent-controlled unit, her lawyer’s demonization of profit is hypocritical.\nCapitalism works because people are trying to profit. That is why communist China switched to a market economy — pulling a billion people out of poverty and supercharging productivity. Yet Tyrell is portraying profit as a\ncause\nof poverty.\nIf the landlord is trying to “maximize profits,” the tenant is trying to minimize rent. Which is really the same thing. Henderson’s profit is her income (Social Security) minus expenses. Her primary expense is likely her rent, which is … wait for it … $640 a month.\n\nThat’s for a two-bedroom in Manhattan, where the\nmedian rent is $4,500\n.\nTo accomplish her goal of maximizing profit, when her longtime roommate died, Henderson, who was not on the lease,\nkept paying the $640 rent in his name\nand hoped the landlord wouldn’t notice. For years, he never did.\nBut in 2017 a new landlord caught on to her ruse and sought to convert the unit from rent-controlled to\nrent-stabilized\n.\nThat is how the law was designed in New York. It’s not a loophole. It’s the intent of the legislation. Fifty years ago, when rent control was replaced with rent stabilization, tenants were allowed to keep their rent-controlled leases until they moved out or died.\nIf the landlord can be said to be “exploiting a loophole” by evicting a tenant who was not on the lease, the tenant can be said to be exploiting a loophole by saying she was the previous tenant’s common-law wife and thus entitled to succession rights.\nThat is what the judge ruled, by the way, although the decision could be reversed on appeal. Both sides certainly have a case. One could even argue that Henderson was the exploiter for occupying a $640-a-month two-bedroom in the name of a deceased tenant.\nBut to give the impression that the decline in rent-controlled units — from 100,000 three decades ago to 24,000 in 2023, as Gothamist noted — is “part of a pattern” to “displace long-term residents,” as Tyrell said, is wrong.\nHere are the facts:\nRent control is being deliberately phased out by the state and replaced with rent stabilization. Landlords are trying to charge and collect the legal rent on their units. Westside Ventura II LLC and Freda Henderson are both trying to assert their rights under state law. The courts will decide who is right.\n",

    "content": "A fast-fashion retailer’s bankruptcy is leaving vacancies in 32 malls across Texas.\nForever 21 filed for bankruptcy for the second time in six years, citing rising costs and increased competition from overseas brands. The company’s operator, F21 OpCo, voluntarily filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on Sunday, the Austin American-Statesman\nreported\n.\nAs part of the restructuring, Forever 21 will begin winding down its U.S. operations while searching for a buyer for its remaining assets. The retailer’s stores and website will remain operational during the process. The company is seeking court approval to use cash collateral to continue paying employee wages and benefits.\nForever 21 has struggled to keep pace with low-cost competitors such as Shein and Temu, which have attracted consumers with trendy fashion at lower prices. While Forever 21 sells T-shirts for around $10, Temu offers similar items for as little as $5, for example. The growing dominance of these online retailers, coupled with economic pressures, has made it difficult for Forever 21 to maintain its market position.\nThe brand first filed for bankruptcy in 2019 before being acquired by a consortium that included Authentic Brands Group and Simon Property Group.\n\nBuying Forever 21 “was probably the biggest mistake I made,” Authentic Brands CEO Jamie Salter said at a conference last year, Retail Dive\nreported\n.\nBut the brand is seeking buyers to salvage the business.\n“Retail is changing, and like many brands, Forever 21 is adapting to create the right balance across stores, e-commerce and wholesale,” Jarrod Weber, global president of lifestyle at Authentic Brands,\ntold\nFox Business.\nHigh occupancy, historic demand and stagnant development have defined the retail market across the Texas Triangle for the past couple of years. While big-box stores such as Conn’s, Big Lots and Party City are shutting down, their spaces are often backfilled by retailers including Burlington and Ollie’s Bargain Outlets, as well as various fitness concepts and specialty grocers, according to Weitzman.\nTexas’ regional shopping malls are healthier after decades of decline and redevelopment. Occupancy was 93.4 percent among Dallas-Fort Worth malls at the end of last year, for example, up from 91.3 percent a year earlier, Weitzman said.\n",

    "content": "A 250,000-square-foot shopping center in Harlem may be on the verge of defaulting on its debt. Grid Properties principal Drew Greenwald isn’t sweating it.\nCo-owners Grid and the Gotham Organization could default on a $108 million mortgage backing Harlem USA at 300 West 125th Street, according to an analysis by credit rating agency KBRA\nreported\nby Crain’s. Investors could take a $26 million hit on the “loan of concern,” according to KBRA.\nThe root of concern appears to be the 26 percent vacancy rate, which is 10 percentage points higher than the neighborhood average, according to the Department of City Planning. Modell’s Sporting Goods, Chuck E. Cheese, and\nBuffalo Wild Wings closed\nduring the pandemic, but none have been replaced so far and 50,000 square feet are left empty. The vacancy rate was only 5 percent the year before the onset of the pandemic.\nThe loan is slated to come due next year, when ownership will likely face interest rates above the current 3.3 percent.\nKBRA estimated the property is worth $82 million, well below the value of the most recent mortgage.\n\nDespite long-term vacancies, co-owner Greenwald said he believes the complex will be fully leased in the next 12 months. He claims an unnamed supermarket will arrive soon and the property is generating more than enough cash to pay its bills. The KBRA analysis appears to validate that confidence, as the property is generating 170 percent of the necessary cash for existing debt obligations.\n“I’m not the least bit worried,” Greenwald told the outlet of KBRA’s analysis.\nHarlem USA, located across the street from the famed Apollo Theater, was the first property in the neighborhood to host national chains. Tenants include Old Navy, which is on a lease for 35,000 square feet set to expire in 2028, and the nine-screen AMC Magic Johnson movie theater, set to continue occupying nearly 70,000 square feet until at least 2030.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Discrimination against voucher holders has been illegal since 2008 but is still one of the most common types of housing discrimination, according to the city’s Commission on Human Rights.\nThe half-dozen bills the City Council is weighing would stiffen penalties against both landlords and brokers for voucher discrimination.\n“We know the stories too well of tenants who are turned away from apartments because they are on a voucher, because they have Section 8, because they have a public benefit,” said Krishnan.\nOne proposal would add source of income discrimination to a list covered by the Certificate of No Harassment program, potentially allowing the city to deny building or construction permits. Another proposal would increase the maximum civil penalty for those who defy Commission on Human Rights orders.\n\nThe other proposals:\nBase landlord fines on the number of buildings they own, increasing penalties for large corporate landlords, a common denominator in source of income complaints\nProhibit credit history requirements for voucher holders\nRequire applicant notification if denial is based on a tenant screening report\nPublic disclosure of landlords found guilty of source of income discrimination\nRental vouchers are one option to help propel households from the city’s shelter system to permanent housing. As of the end of last year, nearly 52,000 households were taking advantage of CityFHEPS vouchers alone, according to city officials.\nOpen discrimination against holders of Section 8 vouchers is\non the decline\n, Housing Rights Initiative founder Aaron Carr told\nThe Real Deal\nlast year, but prospective renters still have horror stories about being ghosted or deterred from using their subsidies.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Aman is hoping to secure funds from both institutional investors and wealthy individuals.\nThe fundraising campaign is not expected to end until early next year. Doronin will use the funds to support the 23 hotel projects already underway across the world, as well as expand the luxury Aman Residences brand.\n“We are working to expand the brand and we’re working with different investment funds and in negotiation with a few different groups,” Doronin said in an interview. “We’re looking for good, solid partners.”\nAmong the projects Doronin has in the works are $39 million mansions in Saudi Arabia’s Riyadh, a pair of luxury buildings in Dubai with 39 apartments each and a 150-key hotel in Dubai’s financial district. There are another 39 projects in the pre-development phase, which are yet to be officially announced.\nDoronin is aiming to expand further into the Middle East and Africa, in addition to creating more hotels under the Janu brand, which caters to younger customers by taking away some of the seclusion aspects of the Aman brand.\n\nThree years ago, Aman raised $900 million from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and London-based Cain International. That gave the company a $3 billion valuation, at the time. Mubadala Capital and Alpha Wave Ventures — a joint venture of Alpha Wave Capital and Chimera Capital — chipping in $360 million a year later.\nAman Residences has sold $5.7 billion worth of properties in the past three years. At the start of the year, Doronin traded the final unit at his luxury hotel-condo conversion known as Aman New York for more than $11,400 per square foot.\nWhile the\n$66 million sale\nwas down from the $79 million asking price specified on the developer’s offering plan, it still marked a sellout for the property.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "In a rarity for commercial real estate these days, the value of a Montauk asset jumped after a short stay in special servicing.\nGurney’s Montauk Resort &amp; Seawater Spa\n— owned by Lloyd Goldman’s BLDG Management – was recently reappraised at $280 million, a 15 percent increase from its $244 million value when the loan was made in 2021.\nA spokesperson for BLDG did not immediately comment.\nWhen the loan was first issued, the high-end resort was the toast of the island. DBRS Morningstar said the hotel “performed extremely well” during the early days of Covid as wealthy New Yorkers flocked to it for a close-to-home oceanside sojourn. But the $271 million loan ultimately landed in special servicing for maturity default in\nlate 2024\n, a transfer BLDG chalked up to an administrative hiccup that delayed the loan extension.\nDespite loan data showing a years-long trend of declining occupancy and revenue that could not cover monthly mortgage payments, the BLDG team stressed that the deal was in good shape.\n“The hotel continues to thrive and remains an outstanding asset in the portfolio,” BLDG COO Justin Kleinman said in January.\n\nAround that time, Gurney’s was shuttered for renovations.\nIn February, the resort reopened and BLDG scored another year to pay off the debt. The trade-off: a $9.4 million\npaydown\nof the loan and a $3.1 million personal guarantee.\nThrough the paydown, BLDG was able to hit a debt yield hurdle — a means to measure asset health by weighing revenue against the loan amount. The $3 million served as an extra cushion if income slipped.\nAny time an asset transfers to special servicing, it typically receives an updated appraisal.\nThe resort’s facelift, which is ongoing, likely drove the value bump. Gurney’s soft-launched The Dune Café &amp; Lounge earlier this winter, according to the\nNew York Post\n. Two other restaurants, Gigi’s Montauk and Gigi’s Café, are set to open this spring, according to\nDan’s Papers\n.\nWhen BLDG and partner Metrovest Equities bought Gurney’s in 2014, the team pumped $54 million into refreshing guest rooms, common areas, amenities and restaurants and building out a $16.4 million spa that draws on ocean water to fill a full-size swimming pool.\n",

    "content": "In recent years, South Florida’s office market appeared resilient to financial woes experienced elsewhere in the U.S. Major companies leased across the tri-county region, making brokers giddy. Developers announced plans for new South Florida office projects, offering flashy renderings.\nYet by now, some of these projects are canceled or paused. The progress and success of others remain in doubt due to a lack of preleasing.\nThe market “was a little bit bullish early on because you saw so many companies coming into town, lots of law firms, lots of financial firms,” said Lisa Colon, a real estate development attorney at Saul Ewing. “That has definitely slowed a little bit … lenders are just requiring more.”\nIndeed, while companies never preleased office space years in advance in South Florida before, this has changed. Financiers generally want to see 30 percent to 40 percent of space preleased before providing a loan for a large project. Brokers said they are seeing a revival of demand in the past three months, which they attribute to the end of uncertainty after the presidential election. But most tenants are looking for small to medium-sized offices and not big headquarter spaces, meaning the uptick in demand isn’t enough to secure the preleasing necessary for major office projects.\n“The majority of the demand I am seeing right now is 5,000 square feet to 10,000 square feet or less,” said Cyril Bijaoui of Longstead at Corcoran. “And that’s why it’s more entry level sort of sizes, and to lease-up a mega floor plate [project], especially prelease it, that’s tough.”\nThe Real Deal’s\nanalysis of the status of office projects proposed from 2021 to 2023 shows that the larger towers are either canceled or paused. One developer put an office project on hold to focus on a smaller one.\nSkyrocketing insurance and elevated interest rates have also played a role. Although the Federal Reserve lowered the benchmark rate three times last year, after 11 aggressive hikes in 2022 and 2023, hopes for more decreases this year are dwindling. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate remains at over 4 percent, though developers tend to pay more than this to cover lenders’ spread.\nPlus, the Trump administration’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as its deportation policies also are expected to boost construction costs. The U.S. construction industry procures most of its lumber from Canada and aluminum and steel from Canada and Mexico, according to Colon.\nHere are the South Florida\noffice\nprojects that developers are canceling and pausing, as well as those that remain in question.\nOne Brickell City Centre\nIn 2022, Swire Properties and Related Companies revealed plans for One Brickell City Centre supertall, marking likely the biggest office project ever envisioned for Miami.\nThe roughly 1,000-foot tall tower would have 1.4 million square feet of offices, with floor plates ranging from 40,000 square feet on upper floors to 60,000 square feet on lower floors. It was slated to rise at Swire’s Brickell City Centre mixed use complex.\nBut in January, Swire nixed One Brickell City Centre, with President Henry Bott\ntelling\nBloomberg “the pre-leasing for that specific scheme has not materialized in the way that we had hoped.” (Related wasn’t involved in the project by then.)\nTo meet lenders’ pre-leasing requirements, the developer would have had to secure tenants for 420,000 square feet to 560,000 square feet of the space before securing construction financing.\nWhile interest in One Brickell City Centre was strong, demand ultimately didn’t meet the needed threshold, according to a source familiar with the project.\nThe 2.8-acre site at 700 Brickell Avenue and 799 Brickell Plaza is for sale. An asking price hasn’t been disclosed.\nGateway Group’s Mid-Beach offices\nLast year, the Giller family jumped on Miami Beach’s office trend with plans for a seven-story building near Mount Sinai Medical Center.\nThe seven-story building at 976 Arthur Godfrey Road and 3915-3925 Alton Road would have had 28,200 square feet of offices on the top three levels. The family’s Gateway Group was betting on both new-to-market and longtime South Florida tenants, as well as medical office demand, Ira Giller said last year.\nConstruction was supposed to start in January. Instead, the Gillers\nsold the site\nlast month.\nThey had budgeted for elevated interest rates and other economic headwinds. But once the Trump administration imposed tariffs and deportation policies, the equation changed, Giller said.\n“\nThat would have a direct impact on the cost of construction. We bring in a lot of construction materials from Canada and Mexico [such as] steel and aluminum,” he said. “My assessment of my cost to build didn’t take into account the implementation of those elements. With 20 [percent] to 30 percent of tariffs and [deporting] 10 million people in labor, I felt like costs were going to go up significantly.”\nOne Thousand Group’s office-to-condos switcheroo\nOne Thousand Group –– led by Louis Birdman, Kevin Venger and Michael Konig\n––\nproposed a 47-story tower with 312,000 square feet of offices in Miami’s Edgewater in 2023.\nIn December, One Thousand Group paid\n$53 million\nfor the 1.6-acre development site at 3601 Biscayne Boulevard and 345 and 409 Northeast 36th Street.\nYet, this time its plans are for a mixed-use branded condo tower with a helipad.\nThe move is in line with South Florida market trends. Last year, offices already experienced less interest from out-of-state firms, more\nsublease availability\nand higher interest rates, prompting some tenants to pause leasing plans. The condo market remains more resilient, with demand from out-of-state buyers continuing.\n\nIn a statement, Venger said One Thousand Group didn’t switch to condos due to any issues with Miami’s office market, arguing the asset class “remains strong.”\nThe development firm “still considers office use within its commercial programming [at the tower], but with tenants re-leasing close to lease end, preleasing is limited,” Venger said.\nOne Thousand Group is best known for completing the Zaha Hadid-designed\nOne Thousand Museum\ncondo tower at 1000 Biscayne Boulevard in downtown Miami.\nAbbhi Capital hits brakes on Miami Worldcenter offices\nIn 2023, Abbhi Capital wanted to bring offices to the massive Miami Worldcenter mixed-use complex, mostly home to condos, apartments and retail.\nThe Coral Gables-based firm proposed a 33-story tower with nearly 370,000 square feet of offices, as part of a larger project that included a 59-story, 558-unit residential building.\nPlans are currently on hold, according to a source familiar with the project, declining to elaborate on the reason.\nGoldman’s Core Wynwood\nGoldman Properties’ Core was supposed to be an eight-story building with 99,400 square feet of offices in Miami’s Wynwood.\nIn 2022, Goldman –– founded by the late Tony Goldman, a pioneer developer in the neighborhood –– scored approval for Core on the 0.6-acre site at 373-391 Northwest 24th Street and 376 and 390 Northwest 25th Street.\nBut construction never started.\n“We are putting it on hold because of rising construction costs and interest rates,” Goldman CEO Scott Srebnick said, adding that Core is paused for about three to five years.\nYet, the firm is still betting on Wynwood’s office market. This year, the city approved Goldman’s five-story 2400 building with 10,000 square feet of retail and 38,000 square feet of offices. It is planned for 2400-2500 Northwest Second Avenue.\nSo how is the 2400 building a better investment now than Core? It will offer smaller suites, ranging from 1,600 square feet to 2,000 square feet, which are in high demand in Wynwood, Srebnick said.\n“Wynwood in particular attracts the entrepreneur, the creative user, the startup. They typically require a smaller office plate,” Srebnick said. It “is very much an entrepreneurial culture with small VCs, small companies, architecture firms, designers.”\nConstruction is expected to start in July, he said.\nBancroft Hotel\nA hotel-to-office conversion on South Beach was first announced in 2021.\nAt the time, Boca Raton-based Pebb Capital, Coconut Grove-based Maxwelle Real Estate Group and Russell Galbut bought the shuttered five-story hotel at 1501 Collins Avenue and a building next door for $47 million from a Galbut affiliate. They announced plans to convert about half the 100,000-square-foot hotel into offices.\nThe project is paused, with other development options under review, Pebb said in a statement.\nKey International’s 848 Brickell\nThe\nArdid family’s\nKey International seized on Brickell’s office boom in 2023 with a proposal for a 51-story, 750,000-square-foot office tower.\nThe project, called 848 Brickell, would replace Key International’s existing 13-story office building on the site at 848 Brickell Avenue in Miami. The firm has its headquarters there.\nKey International, founded by patriarch Jose Ardid and led by his sons, Inigo and Diego Ardid, didn’t immediately return a request for comment. The firm hasn’t formally canceled or announced delays of the project.\nThe Ardids aim to prelease 40 percent to 50 percent of space before pursuing construction financing, Inigo and Diego Ardid told\nTRD\nlast year.\nThe plans also come as Santander Bank and billionaire Ken Griffin pursue their own office towers in Brickell. While most of the space in each will be owner occupied, they also may offer space for lease, posing competition for 848 Brickell, amid less activity from out-of-state firms.\nSantander plans to convert its 14-story building at 1401 Brickell Avenue into a\n41-story tower\nwith about 800,000 square feet of offices. The Spanish bank has its offices at the existing building and will occupy part of the space in the new building.\nGriffin\nfiled plans\nlast summer for a supertall that will serve as headquarters for his Citadel and Citadel Securities. The tower at 1201 Brickell Bay Drive, 1221 Brickell Avenue and 1250-1260 Brickell Bay Drive also will have a luxury hotel, retail and restaurants.",

    "content": "Douglas Elliman honored its top-performing brokers Out East before the summer crowds descend on their turf.\nThe firm announced the winners of its annual Ellie awards on Wednesday, with veteran recipients returning to the top spots on Long Island’s East End. Brokers in the Hamptons\njoined others\nin markets across the country tapped for accolades based on their sales volume, number of transactions and gross commission income in 2024.\nDouglas Elliman claimed the title of the top brokerage in the Hamptons in\nThe Real Deal’s\nlatest ranking\n. The brokerage closed nearly $1.5 billion in sales across more than 430 deals between June 2023 and June 2024.\n“I am incredibly proud of this continued success,” Todd Bourgard, regional brokerage CEO for Long Island, Hamptons and the North Fork, wrote in a statement.\nThomas Cavallo took home the prize for the most sales and commissions earned last year by an individual agent. Though the Sag Harbor-based broker didn’t land the leading post in 2023, has\npreviously ranked\namong the firm’s top producers in the region.\nSecond place went to Martha Gundersen, who was one of the three top finishers in the categories last year. Gundersen, alongside the No. 3 agent by GCI and sales volume Paul Brennan, was the listing agent for an East Hampton property that landed among the\ntop 10 most expensive\ndeals in the hamlet in 2024. The mansion at 253 Cove Hollow Road sold for $19.2 million.\n\nGundersen placed 17th among\nTRD’s ranking\nof the top-producing agents and teams in the Hamptons between June 2023 and June 2024 with nearly $91 million in sales.\nKristy Naddell on the North Fork closed the highest number of transactions for the fourth consecutive year.\nThe Enzo Morabito Team scored the No. 1 spot by sales volume, transactions and GCI. The team also snagged fourth place in\nTRD’s\nlatest ranking with roughly $150 million in sales across 46 deals.\nAlso notable among the teams honored in the Ellies was Noble Black &amp; Partners, who landed among the 10 groups with the largest sales volume last year. The cohort, which was the No. 2 megateam companywide, only officially\nexpanded to the Hamptons\nin May.\nOn the rest of Long Island, Maggie Keats was the top agent by GCI and sales volume, while Barbara Leogrande was the No. 1 in transactions. The Maria Babaev Team was the top-producing team by GCI and sales volume, with the Lina Lopes Team notching the highest number of transactions.\nThis article has been updated to correct the name of Todd Bourgard, head of Elliman’s operations across Long Island.\n",

    "content": "A trio of Manhattan office buildings scored 10-figure CMBS deals in February, another sign of a post-pandemic recovery for trophy commercial properties.\nThe blockbuster refinancings come amid an overall surge in issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities. CMBS issuances totaled $18.3 billion nationwide last month, more than double January’s total of $7.9 billion, according to KBRA. That’s up 196 percent year-over-year, and the bond ratings association predicted “no likely slowdown on the horizon.”\nThe CMBS market is often considered a bellwether for the overall lending market and the broader commercial real estate market.\nIrvine Company’s famed\nMetLife Building\nlanded the largest CMBS deal, a $1.5 billion loan issued by Bank of America and Wells Fargo.\nAnd Aby Rosen’s RFR Holding got some good news for a change, scoring a $1.2 billion refinancing of the\nSeagram Building\n.\nIvanhoé Cambridge’s trophy office tower,\n3 Bryant Park\n, grabbed another massive $1.1 billion CMBS loan.\n“The volumes have been fantastic,” Trepp’s Stephen Buschbom said of bond issuance on The TreppWire podcast. “I’m looking ahead at what’s scheduled into April and we’re just a stone’s throw from hitting $35 billion.”\nThe Real Deal\nbroke down February’s five largest loans in Manhattan and the top five in the outer boroughs:\nNew life for MetLife | $1.5B | Midtown\nBank of America and Wells Fargo\noriginated a $1.5 billion CMBS loan for the Irvine Company’s famed MetLife Building. The loan carries an interest rate of 6.25 percent over 10 years, a sizable jump from the 3.6 percent interest rate Donald Bren’s firm previously faced. The debt-serving costs will double to approximately $100 million a year. The 58-story, 3 million-square-foot building is 94 percent occupied and generates $170 million in net operating income. Ownership, which included Tishman Speyer until it was bought out last year for an unknown price, has invested $180 million in the property dating back to the year before the pandemic.\nRosen refi | $1.2B | Midtown\nMorgan Stanley, Citi Real Estate Funding and JPMorgan Chase\noriginated a $1.2 billion CMBS loan to refinance RFR Holding’s Seagram Building at 375 Park Avenue. The four-year, fixed-rate loan will carry a 6.25 percent interest rate, nearly double the 3.53 percent rate on the existing debt, according to Morningstar Credit. The refinancing package retires $1.15 billion in existing debt, utilizing $24.6 million from existing reserves to complete the payment. The loan structure will fund significant reserves, including a $26 million escrow for contractual free rent and $21.3 million for outstanding landlord obligations. Newmark recently appraised the 38-story, 860,000-square-foot property at more than $1.8 billion. The trophy office tower boasts a 96 percent occupancy rate.\nBryant Park boon | $1.1B | Midtown\nWells Fargo, Bank of America and Bank of Montreal\nprovided a $1.13 billion CMBS loan for Ivanhoé Cambridge’s trophy office tower, 3 Bryant Park. The loan for the 1.2-million-square-foot tower at 1095 Sixth Avenue — located between West 41st and 42nd streets — replaces a CMBS loan\nof the same amount.\nThe fresh financing is an encouraging sign for the Canadian investor, which has\nalmost $5 billion worth of loans\nset to mature in the next year. The real estate arm of Quebec’s $300 billion pension fund tore through U.S. cities over the past decade, paying top dollar to buy top-tier properties.\n\nPark Avenue payday | $500M | Midtown\nCiti Group and JPMorgan\nprovided a $500 million loan to refinance Fisher Brothers’\n299 Park Avenue\n. The fresh financing replaces a $325 million loan from a group of lenders. The landlord recently spent $20 million on a capital improvement project at the 42-story, 1.2 million-square-foot tower, which is 95 percent leased. Capital One and UBS combine to take up 30 percent of the rentable square footage in the building and are in place through 2031. Lease expirations are minimal for the next few years.\nWall Street windfall | $275M | Financial District\nApollo Global Management\nprovided a $275 million loan for\nRockpoint and Brooksville Company’s\nresidential tower at 63-67 Wall Street. The two buildings are converted offices with more than 800 total units. The partners purchased the adjacent buildings from DTH Capital and Metro Loft Management in 2016 for $421.5 million, utilizing a\n$280 million loan\nfrom Wells Fargo. Since then, ownership has renovated the properties, upgrading common areas and amenity spaces.\nLogistics loot | $235M | Maspeth\nNew York Life Insurance Company\nprovided a $235 million loan for RXR Realty and LBA Logistics’ vertical warehouse at\n55-15 Grand Avenue\nin Maspeth, Queens. The fresh financing replaces a $316 million loan from JPMorgan Chase.  The partners\nspent $72 million in January 2018 on parcels\nfor the\nfive-story warehouse\nand\nAmazon agreed to lease the space\nfor its network of last-mile delivery warehouses.\nStorage swag  | $143M | Long Island City\nBank of Montreal\nprovided a $143 million loan to Storage Deluxe for two industrial buildings on 21st and 22nd streets in Long Island City, Queens. The fresh financing replaces an $87 million CMBS loan. The properties at 41-45 21st Street and 41-54 22nd Street span a total of 277,601 square feet.\nRabsky refi | $140M | Fort Greene\nMadison Realty Capital\nprovided a $140 million loan for Rabsky Group’s nearly-completed residential tower at\n240 Willoughby Street\n. The\nsecretive developer led by Simon Dushinsky\nis building a 30-story, 300-unit multifamily building near Fort Greene Park. It also plans to renovate an existing 21-story apartment project with 189 units. Rabsky secured a $72 million construction loan in 2022 from SCALE, the lending arm of Slate Property Group.\nFlatbush funds | $98M | Park Slope, Prospect Heights\nDerby Copeland Capital\nprovided a $98 million loan to Ed and Michael Ostad for their purchase of\na large portfolio of properties\nalong Flatbush Avenue. The Ostads bought the 26-building portfolio of mixed-use properties from Brooklyn’s Pintchik family for $102.5 million.\nShelling out cash | $75M | Coney Island\nGoldman Sachs\nprovided a $74.8 million loan for Elie Fouerti’s multifamily development at 2971 Shell Road in Coney Island. Fouerti Realty and Rybak Development wrapped up construction last year on the eight-story, 189-unit rental building, according to\nNew York YIMBY\n. The fresh financing replaced a $74.8 million construction loan from Popular Bank.",

    "content": "The city is gearing up for a rezoning that could bring 12,000 homes to Jamaica, Queens.\nWith nine months left of the first (and possibly last) term of the Adams administration, one neighborhood rezoning is on the cusp of being approved by the City Council, one just started public review and another is about to do the same on Thursday.\nCity Planning will certify the plan to rezone a swath of Jamaica to allow for the construction of more than 12,000 homes in the Queens neighborhood, of which 4,000 would be income-restricted through the city’s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program. In fact, this would be the largest MIH area ever mapped, according to City Planning. The administration also projects that the rezoning could net 2 million square feet of commercial space.\nThe certification kickstarts the monthslong land use review process, known as the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure. The plan covers more than 300 blocks in and around Downtown Jamaica and will ultimately need buy-in from local Council members Nantasha Williams and James Gennaro, as well as City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, all of whose districts will be affected by the rezoning.\nHere’s a quick recap of where the Adams administration’s neighborhood rezonings stand:\n— The\nAtlantic Avenue rezoning\nis in the home stretch. On Wednesday, City Planning approved the plan, affecting a 21-block stretch in Central Brooklyn, which the city expects 4,600 new homes will be built. The plan now heads to the City Council.\n— In August, the City Council\napproved\nthe rezoning of 46 blocks in the Bronx, where a projected 7,000 homes are expected to be built over the next 10 years.\n— City Planning\nkicked off public review\nof the Midtown South rezoning in January, which would bring 9,700 units to the area.\n— The city released a draft for the planned Long Island City rezoning\nlast June\n, which could create 14,000 units.\nOf course the unit projections depend on developers having the appetite to build said units. Right now, the environment for ground-up development isn’t, shall we say, great. Developers have bemoaned interest rates, high construction costs, the threat of tariffs and the wage requirements for projects looking to receive the property tax break 485x.\nWhat we’re thinking abou\nt: What would it take for one of the mayoral candidates to overtake Andrew Cuomo as the presumptive frontrunner before the June primary? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we’ve learned:\nJamaica, Queens, is named after… beavers? The neighborhood is not named after the Caribbean island but is believed to instead derive from “jameco,” the Algonquin word for “beaver,”\naccording to the New York Times\n.\n\nElsewhere in New York…\n—\nA fourth person in New York has been diagnosed with measles, Gov. Kathy Hochul confirmed on Wednesday. About 81 percent of 2-year-olds in New York have received their first dose of the MMR vaccine, despite federal recommendations that children get the shot between 12 and 15 months old,\nGothamist reports\n. Three of the confirmed cases were in NYC, with one reported out of Suffolk County.\n—\nIt is the end of an era. The MTA will stop selling MetroCards at the end of the year\n,\nthe New York Times reports\n.\n— Former First Deputy Mayor Maria-Torres Springer has a new gig,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. She is starting a fellowship at the Ford Foundation.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Wednesday was\n$6 million\nfor a 1,264-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 685 Fifth Avenue in the Plaza District. McKenzie Ryan, Jade Chan and Alexander Boriskin of Douglas Elliman\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$68.5 million\nfor a 92,722-square-foot, 105-unit apartment building at 237 11th Street in Park Slope. Davidson Kempner sold the property to Living, N.Y.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$18.7 million\nfor a 3,851-square-foot condo at 33 East 74th Street in Lenox Hill. Kevin B. Brown and Craig George of Sotheby’s International Realty have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 60,702-square-foot, five-story school building at 1472 Boston Road in Crotona Park East. Matthew McChesney of KSS Architects filed the permit on behalf of Civic Builders.\n— Matthew Elo",

    "content": "Four years after Los Angeles Council member Nithya Raman introduced a motion to clear out\nillegal, unregistered Airbnb and other short-term rental operations\n, the city may finally be cracking down.\nThe City Council unanimously voted Tuesday to explore how to increase enforcement of its home-sharing ordinance and residential hotel rules,\nCity News Service reported\n.\nThe council directed city departments to report on how much money and people they would need to take action.\nWhat’s not clear is why it took four years for Los Angeles to consider addressing the problem.\nIn 2021, Raman, a Democrat, introduced a motion seeking to address problems with cracking down on illegal home sharing, which she said were “destabilizing” neighborhoods. It was backed by fellow Democrats — Council member Bob Blumenfield and former Council members Mike Bonin, Paul Koretz and Kevin de León.\nThe reason: illegal home-sharing had ushered in party houses, unauthorized events, and large yoga retreats, clothing boutiques and other commercial ventures, according to Raman. They  also led to violent crime and homicides.\nIllegal home-sharing operations also buck up against legal brick-and-mortar businesses, allowing illegal advantages against tenants who rent commercial storefronts, from yoga studios to banquet halls.\nIllegal rentals “take your neighbors away and they remove affordable and protected rent-stabilized units from the long-term housing market, which is bad for L.A.,” Raman stated in her motion.\nRaman said her constituents have been “particularly impacted.” The Fourth District, which she represents, had the highest volume of both permitted and illegal home-sharing, putting a dent in its quality of life.\n\nSince the Home-Sharing Ordinance took effect in 2019\n, there have been problems with enforcement because of poor communication between departments and weak guardrails against bad landlords, Raman said.\nThe law regulates home-sharing through Airbnb, among other platforms.\n“Good hosts go to extraordinary lengths to ensure they’re in compliance with our laws,” Raman said. “We should reward them and make sure that bad-faith hosts are treated with the appropriate enforcement actions.”\nA property owner with a home of 2,500 to 5,000 square feet who has violated the ordinance would face a $3,000 penalty. Subsequent fines would be doubled.\nThe city may increase fines based on square footage of a rental in use during a violation.\nAmong the proposals to beef up enforcement is a public database for permit and citation information, making it easier to file complaints and submit evidence.\nThe Los Angeles Housing Department requested 18 new positions to help with investigations and issuing citations. As of October, about 300 administrative citations were referred to housing regulators, out of an estimated 7,500 home-sharing violators, according to a report.\nCity officials requested more staff to aid the City Attorney’s Office with hearings and nuisance cases, which could lead to more revenue for enforcement.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "A Holmby Hills mansion tied to one of Los Angeles fashion’s most prominent families is back on the market as it tries another price on for size.\nThe Azria Estate at 10250 West Sunset Boulevard, which has been\non and off the market\nfor the better part of a decade, once asked for as much as $88 million. It more recently reentered the Los Angeles real estate market with a $39 million asking price, after last being listed for $55 million in 2023.\nThe re-list comes after seller Lubov Azria, who owned the property with her late husband and BCBG founder Max Azria, placed the home on the auction block last May. Auctioneer Concierge Auctions estimated in the lead up to the sale the starting price could be as much as $38 million.\nLubov Azria did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday on the listing.\nA legal tussle arising after the auction’s close has since stymied any movement on a sale of the property, which even\nJennifer Lopez\nhad been reportedly eyeing in the fall.\nRon Burkle\n, founder of private equity firm Yucaipa Companies, claimed in a Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit last June that his $30 million offer was the highest bid, but Azria “refused to complete the sale except on additional terms.”\nAaron Gordon, general counsel for Concierge Auctions, confirmed in a declaration filed in court Burkle had the winning bid but did not sign the sale agreement or pay the 12 percent escrow deposit within the two-business-day deadline. The tardiness caused Burkle to be in default.\n\nBurkle is now on the hook to pay a little over $36,000 for Azria’s attorney fees and other lawsuit-related costs, a judge ordered in September. Three months later, Burkle filed to drop his lawsuit.\nWith the legal row out of the way, Azria will now try her hand once again at finding a buyer. She tapped The Beverly Hills Estates’ Branden Williams and Rayni Williams to market the property, which sits on a nearly 3-acre lot.\nThe agents did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday on the re-listing or the new price.\nThe Azria Estate counts a total of 60 rooms, including 14 bedrooms and 25 bathrooms.\nThe sizable property has been used to host Oscar parties, charity gatherings and other events.\nBuilt in 1939, the Paul Williams-designed Colonial consists of a main house and a separate 5,500-square-foot theater and game room. Outdoors is a tennis court, infinity pool, sauna, gardens, team room and greenhouse.\n",

Arctos also previously invested in the Giants, according to Sportico.\nSixth Street’s other sports holdings include Legends and NWSL club Bay FC, plus minority investments in the San Antonio Spurs, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

To move forward, approvals will be needed from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council.\n\nThe area has seen\nan influx of interest from developers and real estate investors\nahead of the presidential center’s planned spring 2026 completion. It has also stoked fears of gentrification in the surrounding Woodlawn Neighborhood.\nNeighborhood leaders have proposed various anti-gentrification efforts in the area, including the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance. The ordinance established affordability requirements on all rental and for-sale housing developed on city-owned residential land and gave tenants the\nright of first refusal\nwhen a rental property is sold.\nThe right of first refusal is meant to prevent the area’s naturally occurring affordable housing — particularly two- to four-flats — from being replaced with pricey residential developments. The provision requires landlords to notify tenants when they intend to sell and give them time to match the bid of a third-party buyer.\nChicago’s hotel development pipeline has fallen to the lowest level in recent years as construction lending froze up, with fewer than 1,500 rooms under construction in the fourth quarter, CoStar\nreported\n.",

    "content": "Second-to-last place isn’t usually something to crow about, but when it comes to San Francisco and return-to-office trends, the small victory could be an indication that the city’s commercial market is past the bottom as well.\nFor the first time since\nPlacer.ai began tracking office visits\nin the early days of the pandemic, San Francisco has bested another major U.S. city in RTO figures. The city had 47.5 percent fewer office visits in February 2025, compared with the pre-Covid month of February 2019, while Chicago saw a 48.5 percent decline in the same time period.\nThe nationwide figure is off 36.3 percent, with top markets like New York and Miami only 17 percent and 20 percent behind their respective 2019 office visits. The figures are based on cell phone data from about 1,000 office buildings across the country, typically about 100 buildings per market, and do not include government properties for privacy and security reasons.\nChicago and San Francisco have been the bottom two markets for RTO while New York City and Miami have been at the top since the location analytics company began tracking office visit data in early 2021, according to R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai. The Windy City’s freezing February and the commute-snarling construction on its roadways, along with tech employers pushing more days in office, may have finally lifted San Francisco out of last place, said Hottovy, who is based in Chicago.\n“Congratulations San Francisco!” Hottovy joked of the second-to-last victory. “It’s been a horse race between these two markets for some time now.”\nIn addition, while Placer.ai data shows that RTO appears to be stalling out in many cities, San Francisco is still improving. Nationwide, there was a 6.3 percent drop in office visits in February 2025 compared to February 2024, and only 3.5 percent of that drop can be attributed to last year’s extra day for Leap Year. But San Francisco figures were only down 1 percent, the third-best in the nation after Miami and Boston, which were both at about half a percent below last year. Chicago office visits were down 8.2 percent in that same period.\n“There are green shoots everywhere in San Francisco, and these numbers are an early indication that we are moving in the right direction,” Mayor Daniel Luire, who\nrecently set an April 28 deadline\nfor city workers to be in-office four days a week, told\nThe Real Deal\n. “Our administration is leading by example, and many of our partners in the private sector are on the same page, bringing workers back to the office and kickstarting our downtown recovery.”\n\nSan Francisco Chief Economist Ted Egan cautioned that Placer.ai’s office data “shows a lot of volatility” from month to month, and is just one indicator of RTO strength. But combined with other data points, like increased transit ridership and office demand, it adds up to “good news for the city’s continuing economy recovery,” he said.\nHottovy agreed that he’d like to see a few more months of improved office visit data before he could call the RTO improvement a true trend, but that even this first month out of last place is “encouraging.”\nPopulation numbers have recently started to rise in the city, he said, and\ntech mandates on RTO\nwill continue to have a big impact as well.\n“Maybe there’s some hope,” he said. “Maybe this is the first month of more pronounced recovery in terms of return to office, but it really is too soon to say.”\nThere were 2.2 million square feet of office leased in San Francisco in the first quarter of 2025, according to early data from CBRE, slightly less than the fourth quarter of 2024 but 50 percent higher than the full first quarter of 2024. If San Francisco continues on this leasing trajectory, it will exceed the 8 million square feet leased in all of 2024, according to Colin Yasukochi, executive director of data for CBRE.\nThere were about 5 million square feet of office requirements in the first quarter, which is lower than previous quarters, but represents the highest level of company expansions since the pandemic at just over 20 percent of the total. Almost all of that growth demand is coming from the 30\nAI companies\nwhich are seeking a combined 1 million square feet of office space in the city, Yasukochi said.\nInvestors\ncertainly seem to be betting on San Francisco’s recovery, according to Yardi data. San Francisco was the third-priciest market nationally, with office properties trading at $282 per square foot in the first two months of the year, compared with $177 per square foot nationally and $67 per square foot in Chicago.\n",

    "content": "Altitude Capital Partners has paid $10 million for a Gold Coast building that has long bewildered neighbors as it stood largely unoccupied for almost three decades.\nThe four-story building at 1445 North Dearborn Parkway, dubbed Gold Coast’s\n“phantom building,” has drawn interest from people\nwanting to live in the prime location, but no one has been able to contact the owner.\nAltitude Capital, a Chicago-based development firm, plans to build out the building’s eight condo units with luxury finishes and put them up for sale, Crain’s\nreported\n.\nAs a Gold Coast resident, “I walked my dog past it many times” and wondered about the situation, Altitude Managing Partner Brian Dohmen told the outlet.\nThe 45,000-square-foot courtyard building sold for $222 per square foot, or $1.25 million per unit. It was built in 1901 but was renovated and partially reconstructed in 2010 after part of the building collapsed during a condo conversion. The building has been vacant since then.\n\nThe seller was John Brown, a real estate investor tied to the firms Belden Properties, JAB Properties and Ashton Properties. He has held it since the ’90s, and how much he paid isn’t clear in Cook County property records.\nAt least 60 potential buyers toured the property when it went on the market last fall, and others stopped by to ask questions, Interra’s Colin O’Malley, who represented the seller, told the outlet.\nInterra’s Max Grossman represented Altitude in the deal, which closed March 11.\nThe units range from 2,500 to 5,500 square feet and include two-, three- and four-bedroom condos, with some duplexes. There are also 18 indoor parking spaces on the property that Altitude will offer up with the condos when they go to market.\nAltitude plans to transform the units with finishes and floor plans designed to appeal to wealthy buyers looking to downsize with a Gold Coast home. The condos are set to hit the market in the middle of next year. Dohmen declined to specify price points for the units. The building was previously a 50-room long-term-stay hotel called Dearborn Manor, a name that stuck around until at least the 1950s. Later, it was a 27-unit condo building.\n",

Donald Trump\ntapped the private equity businessman\nto serve as the nation’s top housing regular two months ago.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which support approximately 70 percent of the country’s mortgage market, have been under government control since the housing bubble burst in 2008. Hedge funds and other investors have called for Uncle Sam to release them from conservatorship, but no action has yet been taken.\nStanley’s participation on the Fannie board would have given the Musk ally a key role in deciding the mortgage giant’s future, according to Bloomberg.\nStanley was hired by executive appointment as a temporary “expert” under the director at the Office of Personnel Management, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg through a Freedom of Information Act request.\nHe has trumpeted his involvement with DOGE on social media, but the specifics of his government role are unclear.\nStanley “returned to the private sector last month,” an unidentified spokesperson from OPM told Bloomberg in an email, providing no further details.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

In addition to being anchored by a Publix supermarket, the 11.8-acre property’s tenants include McDonald’s, Elevation Fitness, Wells Fargo Bank, GNC and GoPet Hospital.\nIn August, Publix bought four shopping centers anchored by its stores in Davie,\nLake Worth Beach and Royal Palm Beach\nfor a combined $150 million, including a\n$50.7 million\nacquisition of a 12-acre site with four single-story buildings. It ranked as South Florida’s fifth priciest retail trade of 2024.\nIn May, Publix picked up Ramblewood Square Shopping Center in Coral Springs for\n$58.5 million\n.\nOther investors getting in on the Publix action include Kite Realty Group, led by CEO John Kite. In January, Indianapolis-based Kite acquired Village Commons Shopping Center in West Palm Beach for\n$68 million\n.

HealthStream is offloading space amid a shift toward a hybrid work model; it is downsizing to about 30,000 square feet in the building.\nMemphis-based Boyle Investment Company owns the 300,000-square-foot building.\nOracle filled up the nearby Radius Building, at 601 11th Ave North, where it leases about 150,000 square feet. The company has steadily expanded within that space, adding a full floor last July and another 16,000 square feet earlier this year. With the sublease, Oracle’s office footprint in Nashville now surpasses 200,000 square feet.\nThe building also houses the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce and CoStar Group, which recently leased 34,000 square feet.\n\nOracle’s expansion comes as construction on its planned $1.35 billion East Bank campus has stalled. Nearly four years after securing incentives tied to its goal of employing 8,500 workers in Nashville by 2031, no start date has been announced. The company had roughly 700 employees in the city at the end of 2023, according to state records.\nOracle’s East Bank project, the largest economic development deal in the history of the city and state, gained even greater significance last year when Chairman Larry Ellison announced the site would become the company’s global headquarters. Nashville approved incentives of $175 million, and the state of Tennessee approved $65 million.\nArchitect Norman Foster has been tapped to design the campus, set on 70 acres that Oracle purchased for $277 million.\nTech sector investment has put Nashville at the top of North American office markets. It led net absorption in the United States and Canada, with a 2.3 percent increase between the third quarter of 2023 through the second quarter of last year, according to CBRE.\n—Rachel Stone\n",

    "content": "President Donald Trump said he wanted strings attached to billions of dollars in federal aid to  Los Angeles County, where firestorms this year torched 16,000 homes and businesses.\nBut Republicans in Congress appear to have cooled on conditioning federal aid to California — which doesn’t appear on the horizon months after the Jan. 7 fires in Altadena and the Pacific Palisades,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nLast month, Gov. Gavin Newsom requested\n$40 billion\nin disaster funding, but there’s little movement on any aid.\n“Congress must receive the formal disaster aid request from the administration,” a spokesperson for House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, said in a statement to the Chronicle.\nThe White House declined to comment on when it might send Congress the request.\nTwo weeks after the fires, Trump\nthreatened to withhold federal aid\nfor the thousands of Los Angeles-area residents who lost their homes unless the state requires voter identification at the polls and opens the water spigot to Southern California.\nDisaster aid will likely get attention from Congress when lawmakers return from district work periods on March 24, Republicans Rep Ken Calvert from Palm Desert, and Rep. Doug LaMalfa from Chico, told the Chronicle.\nCalvert, the most senior California lawmaker and the only California Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, said he suspects there will need to be more than one vote on disaster aid, including one to provide additional funding to the\nFederal Emergency Management Agency\n.\n\n“At some point, we’re going to have to put a little more money in FEMA, I think, because obviously the debris removal was extremely expensive,” Calvert told the newspaper.\nMembers of Congress from California, including all nine Republicans, signed onto a\nMarch 7 letter\nurging congressional leadership to provide additional assistance to Los Angeles County.\n“Just as the federal government has come to the aid of communities impacted by wildfires across the western United States, tornados in the Midwest, ice storms in Texas, or hurricanes in the Southeast, we should once again support the recovery of the impacted families, businesses, and communities in Los Angeles County,” the lawmakers said.\nSeveral projections have estimated that insured losses from the January wildfires in L.A. County could reach $30 billion or more, making it the\ncostliest natural disaster in state history\n.\nSeveral California Republicans said they want to see a clearer accounting of existing liabilities to determine how much federal money is needed.\n“FEMA is going through all the numbers and identifying what the costs are, and we’re trying to determine the liability — who’s liable,” whether it’s Southern California Edison, the insurance companies or other entities, Calvert told the Chronicle.\n“Right now, California is hip-shooting a number. They don’t have what amount is insured versus uninsured,” and whether Southern California Edison will have responsibility for the Eaton Fire, added Republican Rep. Darrell Issa from Escondido. “If they have primary responsibility, that’s a huge difference in the funding — literally billions of dollars. So we’re prepared to offer a bill, but to put a number on it we do need these items done.”\nIn January, several Republicans\nfloated the idea\nof making wildfire aid for California contingent on policy changes, an idea that drew a\nharsh rebuke\nfrom Anaheim Republican Rep. Young Kim.\n“Playing politics with people’s livelihoods is unacceptable and a slap in the face to the Southern California wildfire victims and to our brave first responders,” Kim said in a statement.\n—\nDana Bartholomew",

The buildings span 53,709 square feet. Miami Manager sold another outparcel building leased to\nChick-Fil-A\nfor $3.6 million in 2022.\n\nIn 2015, Miami Manager paid $19.6 million for Village Shoppes of Coconut Creek, records show.\nThe fully leased shopping center’s tenants include Hook’s Catch Seafood &amp; Wings, Colella Cosmetic Dentistry, KOA Mart Korean and Asian food store, Belfort Fitness Lifestyle and Pasquale’s Pizza Co. The property generates an annual net operating income of $1.5 million, according to an offering memorandum.\nMiami Manager owns three other shopping centers in Doral, Sunrise and West Palm Beach. In 2022, the firm sold Plantation Marketplace, a shopping center anchored by a Food Fair supermarket in Plantation, for\n$38.4 million\nto Barron Real Estate.\nOutdoor shopping centers like Village Shoppes of Coconut Creek remain safe bets for retail investors at a time when the commercial sector is experiencing headwinds due to recent bankruptcies of big box and national restaurant chains.\nDuring the fourth quarter of last year, Broward County retail landlords slightly increased the average asking rent to $27.84 a square foot, compared to $27.49 a square foot during the same period of the previous year, according to a\nColliers report\n. But Broward’s retail vacancy rate climbed to 4.2 percent, compared to 3.7 percent, year-over-year.",

The port plans to finance the building with a combination of debt and the port’s equity.\nThe building has already started pre-leasing, according to the port’s website.\nPort CEO Jim Perschbach anticipates rents at Innovation Tower could be $50 per square foot, which surpasses rent rates for new office space in popular submarkets like downtown and the Pearl.\n\nPerschbach’s plans to put high-end office space at the port have been questioned, but the port has already built a solid tenant base, he told the outlet.\nThe port has 80 tenants with about 18,000 employees, he said. About 97 percent of the 10 million square feet of space is occupied, he said. The area caters to cybersecurity, defense and aerospace companies; it’s home to offices for companies like Boeing and Accenture.\n“This isn’t just some sort of ‘build it and they will come’ effort,” he told the outlet. “We’re very confident we’ve proven our market.”\nThe numbers back him up; since 2020, the port has increased its operating revenue by 69 percent to $75 million and its net operating income by 56 percent to $29.5 million.\n—Jess Hardin\n",

    "content": "Chicago’s real estate industry is pushing back against the anti-gentrification ordinance that took effect this month, with one group launching a letter-writing campaign against it.\nLandlords and brokers are frustrated with the right of first refusal granted to tenants in some Northwest Side neighborhoods, which allows tenants to band together to purchase their buildings ahead of any outside investor.\nThe Chicagoland Apartment Association and the Neighborhood Building Owner’s Alliance said the right of first refusal will delay the sale of buildings, causing problems for owners who may need to sell quickly, and could have a cooling effect on investment in the area.\n“This ordinance punishes owners of affordable housing, devalues their property, and makes it harder to invest in neighborhood housing,” said Mike Glasser, president of the Neighborhood Building Owner’s Alliance, which launched a letter-writing campaign against the ordinance.\nGlasser’s organization, an alliance of 11 landlord associations, put up a webpage with forms for contacting alderpeople, along with information about the ordinance.\nIt’s also asking members to share personal stories of how the ordinance affected them if they are owners in the area. In addition to legislative tactics, the group is exploring ways to challenge the ordinance in court, according to comments made in an October conference call.\nThey are looking for examples of sellers being harmed by the requirement to give renters in larger buildings a 60-day notice of intent to sell and another 90 days to form a tenant association to decide if they want to buy the building. This timeline is shorter for buildings of four units or fewer, where the total timeline is 45 days.\nThe ordinance was crafted to address documented displacement and gentrification faced by residents in the communities covered by the ordinance, said Kelvin Gensollen Arellano, housing organizer with a community group called Palenque LSNA. The industry’s arguments, on the other hand, are “hypothetical,” he said.\nThe ordinance is a pilot program that will sunset at the end of 2029 unless renewed. The program applies to parts of Logan Square, Avondale, Hermosa, Humboldt Park and West Town as well as Pilsen. It is meant to stem exploding housing costs in areas that began gentrifying rapidly about 10 years ago, when developers started tearing down two- and three-flats and replacing them with luxury homes along the 606 trail. The area lost 6.1 percent of its two- to six-flat buildings between 2013 and 2018, according to the DePaul Institute for Housing Studies.\nIn response to the loss of smaller multifamily buildings, the ordinance also allows for the construction of two-flats by right in any areas within the ordinance’s boundaries that are zoned for single-family. Finally, the measure increased demolition surcharges from $5,000 per unit or $15,000 per building to $20,000 per unit and $60,000 per building, whichever is higher.\n‘Unintended consequences’ and ‘trojan horse’ arguments\nAndy Friedman, a multifamily broker with Kiser Group, said owners and developers will just find ways around portions of the ordinance designed to preserve existing affordable housing and protect against displacement, bringing “unintended consequences” to tenants and sellers.\nFor example, sellers will likely move to vacate buildings before selling as a way of skirting tenant rights, meaning less available housing in the area for that period of time, Friedman said.\nThe ordinance prohibits owners from displacing tenants after purchasing a building, requiring them to keep inherited tenants for 6 months or until the end of their lease, whichever is longer. That could pose a challenge for buyers looking to rehab a property and sellers may want to avoid the elongated timeline of granting tenants the right to first refusal. Vacating a property before bringing it to market may become a more attractive option, said Compass broker Mario Greco.\n\nThe increased demolition fees may hurt owners and sale prices in the area as buyers will take that cost off the top of any offers they make, Friedman said. Though he has not seen evidence of a drop in investment or average sale price yet, Friedman said the ordinance has “definitely changed the attitude” of developers toward the area.\nWith so much of the area’s affordable housing already bought up by outside investors, Gensollen Arellano said most of the money from multifamily sales was not circulating or being reinvested in  local communities anyway. Revenue from the surcharges will go to the Chicago Community Land Trust to support the “construction, rehabilitation or preservation of affordable housing” in the area, according to the ordinance. Developers who plan to reserve at least half of proposed units for families who earn up to 60 percent of the area’s median income are exempt from the increased surcharges.\nThe Chicago City Council\namended the ordinance\nin response to concerns from the industry in December, adding the sunset date, delaying implementation of the right to first refusal until March 1 and requiring tenants to provide proof of financial backing to move forward in purchasing a building. The Chicagoland Apartment Association supported these amendments, but it would prefer for the council to overturn the measure altogether, said the organization’s executive vice president Mike Mini. It’s unlikely there is any political will to do so given strong support for the ordinance among aldermen, he said.\n“I’m certain that the evidence is going to show that this is not an effective ordinance, and perhaps then there’ll be an opportunity to revisit this,” Mini said. “If there’s an opportunity to overturn it, we certainly would participate in that.”\nMeanwhile, Palenque LSNA, which\nworked to get the ordinance passed last fall\n, has launched an education campaign of its own, canvassing Northwest Side neighborhoods to inform tenants about their rights.\n“This is the first step,” Gensollen Arellano said. The second step has been talking with tenants about the kinds of “legal, logistical and financial support” they might need in order to execute their rights, so that Palenque and others can help bridge that gap, he said.\nBrokers who work in the area said they have yet to see an example of tenants organizing to match an offer from a third-party buyer to purchase their building, and Mini said he doubts the likelihood of it happening, particularly in larger buildings.\nThe timeline afforded to tenants to organize represents an unnecessary delay that will disadvantage small, live-in owners who may have more logistical and timing constraints around buying a property if they are taking out a mortgage, said NBOA member Joe Wilcox, a property manager and broker.\nThe ordinance states that 75 percent of occupied units should be in agreement in order for tenants to move forward with buying their building. That’s more of a challenge in larger buildings, but Palenque LSNA is working to provide support to tenants on a case-by-case basis. Tenants can also opt to transfer their right of first refusal to a third-party organization that is committed to keeping the building affordable, Gensollen Arellano said.\nIndustry players’ arguments that reforms will end up hurting renters or local, small-time landlords are often a “trojan horse” for less community-minded concerns, he said.\n“Most of the people who are purchasing these two-flats and three-flats are not families. Most of them are very big companies that are trying to resell them at a very big price and de-converting these units into luxury homes,” he said. “It’s a rational period of time to ask people to wait 30 days. It’s not like the entire world will end during this period of time.”\nBut Mini and others in the industry maintained that if the city really wanted to protect affordable housing in the area, they would remove restrictions on sellers, open up zoning and make it easier to increase the overall supply of housing.\n“The ordinances in the city of Chicago are such that it makes it very, very difficult to operate a rental property, and that puts upward pressure on rents. Costs are skyrocketing. Insurance is going up. Property taxes are high. Utility charges are high. It’s difficult to get financing,” Mini said. “There’s just a lot of headwinds in the apartment industry right now, and until we change our policies to make it easier to build and maintain properties, we’re going to continue to have this problem.”\n",

    "content": "Two residential projects are bringing over 1,000 homes to a fast-growing suburb east of Dallas.\nRockwall City Council green-lighted a development called Juniper, from a joint effort between Canada-based Qualico Developments and Rockwall-based Michael Joyce Properties, and another called Erwin Farms, from Dallas-based Skorburg Company, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nJuniper, spanning 526 acres, will bring 885 homes, over 7 acres of trails and 126 acres of open space, including 33 acres of city parkland to the intersection of John King Boulevard and South Goliad Street. Construction is planned in six phases over 11 years, with work on the first phase beginning in June. A second phase is expected to launch in 2027. Qualico’s business units include Sterling Homes and Pacesetter Homes, and it opened a McKinney office in 2018.\nThe 98-acre Erwin Farms, near North Country Lane and FM 1141, will include 123 lots, hiking and biking trails, and two multi-use sports courts. Prices are estimated to range between $750,000 and $1.2 million, with construction expected to span six years. The first residents could move in by mid-2028.\n\nThe developments underscore Rockwall County’s rapid transformation. The county’s population has increased 4 percent in the past year alone, surpassing 137,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Since 2020, it has grown an estimated 25 percent, making it one of Texas’ fastest-growing counties, second only to neighboring Kaufman County.\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth home building market is experiencing significant growth, driven by strong demand and a robust development pipeline. The region is a leader in construction permits,\ntrailing only Houston\nnationally.\n—Rachel Stone\n",

    "content": "An unrecognized Native American tribe from San Francisco ramped up its claim to the Presidio after President Donald Trump ordered an end to the federal trust overseeing the national park.\nThe Muwekma Ohlone Tribe formally requested the president return the 1,500-acre park at the base of the Golden Gate bridge to its supervision, where it would create a new reservation, the\nSan Francisco Standard\nand\nKRON4\nreported.\nThe Manteca-based tribe that once inhabited San Francisco said the move “would reduce federal taxpayer spending and constitute one of the most significant rematriations of Indigenous land in U.S. history,” according to a statement.\nThe request comes after Trump\nissued an executive order\nlast month to dissolve the Presidio Trust, established by Congress in 1996 to redevelop the former military base and manage the park and its nearly\n200 commercial tenants\n.\nThe Trust is operating in the black, earning $182 million last year while reinvesting\n$58 million\nin net operating income back into the park. It relies on Presidio profits and private donations,\nnot taxpayer money\n, according to a Trust report.\nThe White House didn’t respond to a request for comment by the Standard.\n“This is an opportunity for President Trump to do what the state of California has failed to do,” Charlene Nijmeh, chair of the tribe, said in a statement. “Not only will returning the Presidio to Indigenous care be the right thing for our people and for the land, but it will also save the federal government — and taxpayers — money.”\nThe tribe, working with the Lakota People’s Law Project, has launched a\npetition\nseeking public support for the initiative.\n\nTribal officials said they submitted a right of first refusal to the federal government during the decommissioning of the military base in 1992, but faced opposition from prominent California politicians, including the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, both Democrats.\nIn the petition addressed to Trump and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe called the Presidio “a beautiful national park on the tribe’s traditional homelands in San Francisco.”\nIt said the goal of the petition is to “rematriate” the Presidio and “establish a new reservation” there.\n“Rematriation,” according to the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust, is “Indigenous woman-led work to restore sacred relationships between Indigenous people” and “ancestral land.”\nThe tribe said the “rightful return” of the Presidio would be “an extraordinary act of reconciliation” and that the Muwekma people maintain a “deep cultural and spiritual connection to the Presidio lands.”\nThe Muwekma Ohlone Tribe claims on its\nwebsite\nthat it was once federally recognized as the Verona Band of Alameda County but was omitted from the Bureau of Indian Affairs’ first official list of recognized tribes, drafted in 1978, according to the Standard.\nThe tribe has sought to reaffirm its federal status for more than 45 years. There are 614 members of the tribe, living mostly across the Bay Area, an unidentified spokesperson told the newspaper.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Former CrowdStreet chief executive officer\nTore Steen\nand\nrecently departed\nchief investment officer Ian Formigle are also named as defendants.\nThe investors — a class believed to be at least a thousand strong — are seeking to rescind more than $1 billion of investments made on the platform before 2023. That’s the year CrowdStreet secured a broker-dealer license with the Federal Industry Regulatory Authority. Schwartz defrauded investors of $63 million the year before.\nThe plaintiffs claim CrowdStreet operated as an unregistered broker-dealer for years, selling and marketing securities and collecting commissions without properly protecting investors, in violation of securities laws.\nThe company claims that before it received its license, CrowdStreet was a neutral marketplace that connected investors to developers and sponsors but didn’t promote or recommend investments. The suit counters with claims that CrowdStreet acted more like an investment bank — promoting deals, conducting due diligence and earning fees.\n\nThe lawsuit includes a document showing a plan for CrowdStreet to pursue a FINRA license dating back to 2021.\nCrowdStreet CEO John Imbriglia warned customers last week that the investors in the lawsuit were trying to “capitalize on the Nightingale situation by launching baseless lawsuits against CrowdStreet.” Imbriglia added that the company “will not let it distract us from our goals and mission.\nCrowdStreet is facing a growing legal groundswell, though. This month, 125 investors roped into a campaign to raise $25 million for the acquisition of a Chicago office building\nfiled an arbitration claim\nagainst the company, demanding the platform cover more than $7 million in losses for allegedly ignoring red flags in the deal.\nSchwartz, meanwhile,\npleaded guilty\nto fraud last month.

The Indiana man will also receive three years of supervised release and 500 hours of community service.\n“Jonathan Larmore treated the stock market like a game he could rig to obtain instant riches at the expense of innocent investors,” Acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky said in a statement.\nIn the fall of 2023, Larmore created a sham real estate investment firm, Cole Capital, and spent $775,000 to buy WeWork call options and hundreds of thousands of shares of common stock. In November, he published a bogus press release, announcing Cole Capital was proposing to acquire a majority of all outstanding shares owned by a minority shareholders at a massive premium, an all-cash offer that would’ve been worth $77 million, had it been real.\nAt the time, WeWork was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. Larmore never had the intent or ability to follow through on his offer, according to prosecutors.\nAs soon as the release went out, WeWork’s share price immediately jumped 70 percent and ultimately surged 150 percent above the pre-press release price. The call options Larmore held expired before the press release was published, though, keeping him from a payday worth tens of millions. WeWork\nfiled for bankruptcy\nshortly thereafter.\n\nA jury convicted Larmore in October following a weeklong trial and two hours of deliberation.\nLarmore founded Arciterra Companies in 2005, which bought, renovated and refinanced strip malls. By 2023, the company had acquired more than 80 properties and was worth more than $600 million, only for rising interest rates to reduce valuations for residential and commercial properties, putting him on the defensive side of lawsuits brought by vendors and investors.\nIn one case,\ninvestors filed a federal lawsuit\ncentered on Belleville Crossing, an Arciterra strip mall in St. Clair County, Illinois. They accused Larmore of using funds from 175 investors to finance a lavish lifestyle while neglecting lease renewals, regular bill payments and critical repairs on the property.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also sued Larmore in November 2023, accusing the strip mall mogul of misappropriating over $35 million from his company.\n",

That must be our total focus. There is a time and place for politics, but it is not now.”\nBass, under siege since the nearly 24,000-acre\nPalisades Fire\n, faces a recall campaign\nled by Los Angeles realtor Nicole Shanahan\n, former presidential running mate of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. A recall would require 330,000 ballot signatures in four months.\nThe\nrecall effort gained steam\namong opponents who criticized the mayor for traveling to Ghana when the fire erupted on Jan. 7, despite advanced warnings from weather officials that severe winds would create extreme fire conditions.\nConcerns mounted over L.A. fire hydrant issues, low water pressure in the Palisades and resources within the Los Angeles Fire Department.\n\nFirefighting efforts were hampered when\nwater supplies ran out\nas crews tried to save entire neighborhoods.\nSome critics say Bass tried to shift blame for the response\nby firing former LAFD Chief Kristin Crowley\n.\nRumors have swirled\nsince last year\nthat Caruso could return to politics, with another bid for mayor or a candidacy for California governor when Newsom is termed out next year. Caruso also\nlaunched\nSteadfast LA, a private-sector recovery effort, sparking speculation about a possible second mayoral run. He has yet to make an official announcement.\nBass, who is up for reelection in 2026, has already launched her campaign. In an interview with KNX News, the mayor said she would fight any attempts to boot her from office.\n“I would never quit on my city. This is where I was born and raised,” Bass told the radio station. “Did I know that it was a difficult job? Absolutely. Am I ready for the job? Most definitely.”\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Google didn’t provide a specific timeline but confirmed its plan to move in later this year. The full-building lease expires in 2038.\nGoogle has eaten more than $53 million a year by paying for the trophy property lease it hasn’t used, the Austin Business Journal estimated.\nGoogle employees\ncurrently work\nin East Austin’s Saltillo development or at the skyscraper at 500 West 2nd Street, next to the Sail Tower, according to the Austin Business Journal.\n\nThe Sail Tower, at 601 West 2nd Street, traded hands in December, when developer Trammell Crow Company sold it to Atlanta-based Cousins Properties for $521.8 million.\nAt the time, Cousins’ Tim Hendricks said he “felt very comfortable in Google and Google’s plans for the city of Austin” despite the fact that the company hadn’t moved into the property at the time of the sale, Austin Business Journal reported.\nIndustry experts are hopeful that return to office mandates from major companies like Google will buoy the troubled office market, which has suffered since the pandemic made remote work the norm.\nWhile Austin’s office market vacancy has slowed its rapid acceleration, it still sat at 25.2 percent at the end of last year, JLL\nreported\n.

    "content": "Bally’s is hedging a bet on its controversial diversity-focused fundraising plan for its $1.7 billion Chicago casino development on the former Tribune newspaper printing plant site in River West.\nBally’s Chicago is now seeking to raise $195 million through a private share sale, as the Securities and Exchange Commission has halted an effort to raise $250 million through an initial public offering exclusively targeted at women and minority investors, the Chicago Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe shift in fundraising methods comes as the company, a subsidiary of Rhode Island-based Bally’s Corp., is navigating significant regulatory challenges for its project, which is set to become the Windy City’s first full-fledged permanent gambling emporium.\nLast summer, Bally’s Chicago garnered attention with plans for a $250 million IPO exclusively targeting qualified female and minority investors. This initiative was prompted by a mandate from the city of Chicago, stipulating that 25 percent of the new casino must be owned by minorities and women. However, the SEC has yet to approve the IPO, citing the need for updated audited financials from Bally’s Chicago.\n\nIn response to the regulatory delay, Bally’s launched a private placement offering, which has already secured over $83 million from 270 accredited investors, the outlet reported, citing the firm’s financial disclosures. This approach is running alongside the stalled public offering and includes individuals who meet the criteria specified by Chicago’s ownership mandate, according to Bally’s spokesperson Richard Land.\nLegal hurdles loom, however. The IPO has faced federal court challenges, with accusations of discrimination leveled by plaintiffs supported by groups like the American Alliance for Equal Rights and the Liberty Justice Center. These lawsuits argue that the IPO unfairly favors minority and female investors, potentially excluding others from participating in the investment opportunity.\nMeanwhile, Bally’s continues to refund deposits to potential IPO investors as it strives to gain SEC clearance. The company remains optimistic about its casino project, which has recently received site plan approval and is slated to open in September 2026. The complex promises a 500-room hotel, entertainment venues, multiple dining options, and public spaces, and aims to redefine Chicago’s hospitality and gaming scene.\n— Sam Lounsberry\n",

    "content": "Savills is consolidating its two Los Angeles offices — one in Downtown and the other in Westwood — and expanding with a move to around 20,000 square feet in Century City.\nThe tenant-side brokerage plans to take the entire 11th floor at Anderson Real Estate’s 1900 Avenue of the Stars sometime this summer. It will relocate from 7,800 square feet at 777 South Figueroa Street and 9,973 square feet at 1100 Glendon Avenue, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.\nThe length of the lease, a Savills spokesperson said, is “multi-year.”\nAsking rent in the building ranges from $6.50 to $7.50, according to a spokesperson for CBRE.\nThe Century City building, a 28-story, 627,000-square-foot, Class-A high-rise office building, is undergoing a $100 million redevelopment together with 1800 Avenue of the Stars by owner\nCentury City-based\nAnderson. The redevelopment will be completed in the second quarter, per the Anderson spokesperson.\nThe new digs aim to “create a new, experiential office environment,” Savills Los Angeles region President Josh Gorin, who oversaw lease negotiations for the firm, said in a statement.\n\nPeter Best of LA Realty Partners and David Freitag, Kayla Rix and Rocky Binswanger of CBRE represented the building in lease negotiations. Best didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nWhen asked why Savills would want to leave Downtown L.A., Gorin said via a spokesperson: “Century City offers a prime location that puts us near key clients in industries such as entertainment, legal, financial, and other professional services firms.”\nOffice leasing bounced back across L.A. County at the end of last year, though the bulk of the deals were renewals.\nThe L.A. office market had its best quarter since the start of the pandemic in the fourth quarter, with 3.9 million square feet leased, from 1.7 million square feet a year earlier, according to Savills data.\nAmong the top 10 transactions in Q4, one was in Century City, according to a list from Savills. Loeb &amp; Loeb renewed its 130,000-square-foot space at 101000 Santa Monica Boulevard. Savills’ 40,000-person operations span seven countries.\n",

    "content": "A group of high net worth investors has purchased the historic Ambassador Chicago Hotel out of receivership after years of financial distress for the Gold Coast landmark.\nA venture managed by Wheeling-based investor Marsha Forsythe acquired the 285-key property at 1301 North State Parkway, Crain’s\nreported\n, resolving a 2023 foreclosure lawsuit that accused the hotel’s previous owner — an affiliate of Chinese investment firm Gaw Capital — of defaulting on a $38.5 million loan when it matured last May.\nThe purchase price was not disclosed, but court records show the buyer reached a deal last summer to acquire the hotel for $30.5 million, or roughly $107,000 per key. It’s a sharp drop from the $60 million Gaw Capital paid for it in 2016.\nThe buyers have added the Ambassador to a cluster of independently managed hotels operated by the Chicago Hotel Collection, which also manages three other properties downtown and in Wrigleyville.\nSeller Gaw Capital invested $11 million in renovations and rebranded the hotel under the Hyatt Joie de Vivre collection in 2020.\n\nThe pandemic forced the hotel to shut down for nearly a year, and it struggled to recover amid a slow rebound for the city’s hospitality sector.\nDowntown Chicago hotels remain below pre-pandemic levels, when adjusted for inflation, despite some signs of a recovery. Revenue per available room was 11 percent higher last year than in 2019, but inflation-adjusted figures show the sector still lagging, according to CoStar.\nThe buyers must stabilize the hotel’s operations fast if they want to turn a profit. The hotel lost $1.2 million last year on $13.9 million in revenue, according to CMBS loan data from Bloomberg.\nThe Ambassador is now the largest hotel in the Chicago Hotel Collection’s portfolio. The company hasn’t revealed renovation plans but has stated the ownership will “honor the hotel’s storied legacy” while introducing upgrades.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "The Swig Company has signed two new artificial intelligence tenants at 501 Second Street in SoMa, for nearly 20,000 square feet combined, according to a press release from the San Francisco-based owner and developer.\nLangChain, an open-source framework for building applications using large language models, is taking 11,800 square feet in the seven-story 200,000-square-foot former warehouse, while unitQ, an AI-enabled product quality and user experience analytics platform, has signed on for 7,500 square feet.\nA Swig representative said that the company could not comment on specific lease terms like length, price per square foot and tenant improvements, but did say unitQ moved in in February, while LangChain is expected to do so May 1.\nCory Kristoff, Swig’s director of leasing, said in a statement that the company was happy to welcome “two San Francisco-based enterprises advancing the application of artificial intelligence in business” and that it looked forward to “supporting their future growth.”\nMike McCarthy, Brian McCarthy and Maddie Meyersieck of Transwestern represented Swig in both transactions. They did not immediately reply to a request for comment via a spokesperson.\nA Transwestern marketing page for the property indicates that the recently snagged LangChain space is Suite 120, which is located directly off the lobby and has two large conference rooms, five smaller huddle rooms, a private shower, an open kitchen/dining area and 16-foot-high ceilings. The unitQ space appears to be Suite 212, which has 10 conference rooms and an open kitchen. A Swig representative would not confirm the suite numbers.\nThere are still seven vacant suites in the building totaling about 50,000 square feet, according to the site, which also shows three of those have been undergoing spec suite renovations. They will be delivered in April, Swig confirmed.\n\nBlake Walker and Caroline O’Loughlin Livermore of CBRE represented LangChain. Walker said LangChain would be moving into a furnished space, which “minimized disruption” so they could focus on their business and give their team “an office they enjoy coming into.”\n“The decision to move to 501 Second Street was driven by favorable economics, term flexibility, and a high-quality workspace that supports their growing team,” he said.\nWill Cassriel and Grant Dettmer of JLL represented unitQ. They did not immediately reply to a request for comment via a representative.\nAI has been touted as the likely taker for a substantial portion of San Francisco’s one-third-empty office space. There were\n86 AI leases signed last year\nin the city, according to Kilroy analysis, with AI expected to drive another 1 million to 1.5 million square feet in absorption this year. Tech office leasing was up 17 percent last year,\ndriven by AI\ndemand, according to CBRE.\nAI companies are “absolutely” having an impact on the office market, Walker said, adding that with 5 million square feet of leased space, the city’s 200 AI companies represent nearly 9% of the total occupied office space in the city.\n“These AI companies recognize the strategic value of being in San Francisco—not just for access to talent and investors, but for building in-office cultures that will help shape the future of downtown,” he said.\nIf more of these AI companies come to SoMa, it would be a much-needed boost to the neighborhood, which has been\nhit harder than other SF markets\nby tech’s office retreat since the pandemic. At the end of 2024, SoMa was 40 percent vacant, compared to 36.5 percent citywide, according to CBRE data.\n",

    "content": "Haley Hospitality Enterprises has snapped up a 121-room hotel in Laguna Hills for nearly $17 million after selling a hotel in Costa Mesa at a hefty profit for a hotel-to-residential conversion.\nThe Lake Forest-based hospitality firm led by Bhavesh Ahir bought the three-story Laguna Hills Lodge at 23932 Paseo De Valencia,\nthe Orange County Business Journal\nreported, citing CoStar. The seller was locally based LHMLP.\nThe deal works out to nearly $140,500 per room. Brokers Oliver Shah and Justin Myers of Atlas Hospitality Group represented the buyers. It’s not clear what LHMLP paid for the property, and when.\nThe 87,500-square-foot economy class hotel, built in 1968, is near Interstate 5 at El Toro Road. Its rooms were recently offered for discount rates for refugees of January’s fires in Pacific Palisades and Altadena.\nHotel sales in central and south OC have cooled, according to CoStar. Sales between Newport Beach and Dana Point were $125 million during the last “volume year,” compared to a three-year average of $340 million a year.\nThe market didn’t prevent Haley from doing well in its sale late last year of a 120-room Travelodge by Wyndham Orange County Airport/ Costa Mesa at 1400 Bristol Street\nIn December, the county agreed to buy the Travelodge from Haley for conversion into homeless housing under the state’s\nProject Homekey program\n. The hotel purchase and conversion into 78 supported apartments was to cost\n$45 million\n.\n\nThe $45 million redevelopment project, dubbed Homekey Bristol, included a $4 million contribution from Costa Mesa and $3 million from neighboring Newport Beach. Orange County kicked in $7 million and nearly 50 project-based vouchers. The grants totalled\n$14 million\n.\nThe bulk of the money came from a Project Homekey grant from the state Department of Housing and Community Development, which kicked in\n$29 million\nfor the project led by American Family Housing. The Midway City-based nonprofit developer was to revamp the motel and run it as supportive housing.\nSuch grants generally cover the purchase of the property. In the case of the Travelodge, that means Haley likely sold the 120-room hotel for $29 million, or $241,667 per room.\nHaley Hospitality bought the Travelodge, built in 1970, in 2021 for\n$14 million\n, or $116,667 per room, according to the Central OC Times. The purchase came at the height of the pandemic, when the\nhotel industry tanked\nwhile\ntens of thousands of rooms\nwent dark.\nThree years later, the county, via a grant from the state, bought the 54-year-old motor inn for a 107 percent markup for its last traded price. And Haley walked away with a windfall.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Economic analyst the Perryman Group conducted a study that validated Hunt’s fears and found the train could lead to the closing of the Hyatt and billions in losses for the city.\n\nProponents of the rail line claim moving the convention center would delay the opening of the facility and stymie the development of the train, which the North Central Texas Council of Governments has spent years planning.\nHunt president Colin Fitzgibbons said in a statement that he heard the city was still exploring location options for the convention center. Although a groundbreaking ceremony was held last year, the convention center design hasn’t been finalized; plans for the facility have shifted multiple times.\nConcerns about the train project compelled Dallas City Council to back an alternative route for the train last summer; officials said they’d revisit the issue after reviewing the economic impact of various high-speed routes.\nHunt is also the developer behind NorthEnd, a $5 billion mixed-use development that will include a\n$500 million campus\nfor Goldman Sachs.\n–Jess Hardin\n",

    "content": "The National Association of Realtors is in the doghouse.\nThe Chicago-based organization’s reputation hasn’t recovered from recent setbacks, and it is unpopular with real estate professionals as well as the general public, according to the\nHousing Sentiment Survey\n, conducted by Lance Lambert’s real estate analytics site ResiClub. It ranked NAR near the bottom among 16 real estate-related entities, with 62 percent of real estate agents and brokers holding an unfavorable view of the organization, Crain’s\nreported\n.\nAmong executives in real estate and housing, 66 percent reported a negative perception, while 68 percent of the general public viewed NAR unfavorably.\nSome top Chicago-area agents weren’t surprised.\nNAR is “so far out of touch with reality” that it failed to anticipate the class-action lawsuits challenging its long-standing commission model, prominent Compass agent Mario Greco said.\nThe organization, which most agents must join to access multiple listing services, has been under intense scrutiny following a\nsexual harassment scandal in 2023\nand a federal jury ruling that found NAR and large brokerages\ncolluded to keep commissions artificially high\n, making homeownership costlier.\n\nIn response, NAR abandoned its previous commission standards\nlast August\n, but the lack of a unified standard to replace it has\nleft the industry in flux\n.\nJennifer Ames, head of Engel &amp; Völkers Chicago, offered a more measured view, acknowledging that while NAR’s lobbying has been “important” for homeowners, its reputation has taken a major hit. The group has been instrumental in shaping fair housing efforts and advocating for policies like the mortgage interest income-tax deduction.\nNAR CEO Nykia Wright has been\nworking to repair the trade group’s image\n, introducing conduct standards and focusing on restoring trust.\nThe organization responded to the survey results by stating it is committed to strengthening relationships with brokerages, local associations and industry partners.\nAgents are skeptical despite the efforts. Marina Carney, a Compass agent in Lake Forest, said NAR is “a fine mess” but added that meaningful change will take time.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "Dallas officials secured a meeting with Saks Global as they make a final push to keep the Neiman Marcus flagship open downtown, but the retailer insists its decision to close remains unchanged.\nDallas City Manager Kimberly Bizor Tolbert will meet with Saks executives next week following the city’s latest attempt to pitch what it describes as a “financially beneficial” offer, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. Where the meeting will take place wasn’t reported.\nThe meeting comes after Tolbert and the Dallas Consortium, a coalition of business and civic leaders,\nsent a letter\nto Saks Executive Chairman Richard Baker and others, urging a discussion before the store shutters on March 31.\nSaks has “always been open to speaking with the city manager of Dallas,” it said in a statement, but reaffirmed that its decision to close the downtown Neiman Marcus location, which it\nmade in February\n, has not changed.\nThe letter to Baker claimed that keeping the store open for a few more months would allow Saks to “capture the opportunity we wish to discuss.”\n\nThe city has not publicly disclosed details of its proposal but previously worked to remove a major barrier to keeping the store open by securing the deed to a disputed portion of the property earlier this month.\nSaks, which acquired Neiman Marcus for $2.7 billion last year, has\npushed back on the city’s efforts\n, arguing that the situation is “far more complicated than what the public is being led to believe.” The company, which is owned by Hudson Bay Company, has also claimed that some of its previous attempts to engage with Dallas officials were rejected.\nThe meeting is the latest development in an ongoing effort to preserve the store, which has been a landmark in downtown Dallas for over a century. The closure threatens to leave a major void in the city’s retail core, as Neiman Marcus also plans to vacate its 82,000-square-foot headquarters at Cityplace Tower.\nWhile Dallas officials hold out hope for a deal, Saks is already moving forward with plans to invest $100 million into its Neiman Marcus location at NorthPark Center, suggesting its focus is shifting away from downtown.\n— Judah Duke\n",
