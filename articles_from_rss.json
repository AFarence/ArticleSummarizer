Colliers is handling the sale.\nFoothill-DeAnza budgeted $28 million for renovations, according to a memo, which will make the complex accessibility compliant and add safety features to the swimming pool.\nIt will finance the acquisition and renovations from an $898 million bond measure approved in 2020.\n\nThe college district had considered building its own student housing until soaring construction costs and a potential delay in plans to move in by 2028 move-in date pushed the district board to opt to buy instead. The cost of a proposed apartment development was not disclosed.\nThe 100,000-square-foot McClellan Terrace Apartments, built in 1971 on 5 acres, has one- and two-bedroom units. The 94-unit property has the potential for 332 beds, not far from the 144-unit and 376-bed apartment building the school had considered building.\nIt’s also closer to Foothill-De Anza Community College than the proposed building site, a seven-minute walk from the college compared to the 4 miles students would have to drive from the undisclosed building site.\nFoothill-DeAnza intends to start renting the apartments to students in August and September, prior to the fall semester.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Another CrowdStreet executive has left the company.\nBrendan Sparrough, CrowdStreet’s former head of capital markets, has departed the embattled crowdfunding platform for a new position with a real estate private equity firm, according to a post on LinkedIn.\nSparrough is now the second high-level executive to leave CrowdStreet, a platform that allows everyday investors to invest in real estate, in recent weeks.\nCrowdStreet’s former chief investment officer\nJohn Imbriglia\nrecently announced on LinkedIn that he accepted a new role.\nFive employees working as investment managers or analysts left CrowdStreet in February, according to a review of FINRA’s BrokerCheck.\n“Personnel change is inevitable when you are expanding your value proposition and it is no secret CrowdStreet is actively structuring our business model to expand to other asset classes, including with several new executive hires over the past several months. CrowdStreet is evolving,” said a spokesperson for CrowdStreet.\nSparrough played a key role in CrowdStreet’s relationships with institutional clients, leading the company’s capital markets team that sourced and selected deals for the platform.\nSparrough oversaw the origination and closing of over $1.7 billion in equity across more than 100 real estate investments, according to his LinkedIn. He accepted a new position with O’Connor Capital Partners as the head of capital formation.\n\nThe platform has come under pressure from investors because of the Elie Schwartz fiasco. Nightingale Properties CEO Elie Schwartz recently pleaded\nguilty\nto one count of wire fraud where Schwartz acknowledged misappropriating $54 million of CrowdStreet investor funds designated for an acquisition of an office complex in Atlanta and a commercial property in Miami Beach. Schwartz faces up to 20 years in prison.\nInvestors have turned their eye on CrowdStreet in light of Schwartz’s guilty plea. A group of about\n125 investors\nin a Nightingale office project in Chicago filed a claim in arbitration demanding CrowdStreet cover $7.2 million in losses, alleging the firm failed to see clear issues with Nightingale and Schwartz, according to Bisnow.\nCrowdStreet has claimed to be a victim of Schwartz’s fraud and alerted authorities about the wrongdoing.\nIn the summer of 2023, an independent manager for investors in Nightingale’s projects announced in a webinar that most of their money had been misappropriated. Schwartz allegedly used that money for personal expenses and other Nightingale projects. He used $12 million of investor funds to bet on First Republic\nbank’s stock\nand options prior to the bank’s seizure by regulators.\nCrowdStreet came under scrutiny because it failed to require Schwartz to hold the money in a designated escrow account.\nCrowdStreet’s long-time CEO\nTore Steen\nleft the firm weeks after the news of the Nightingale scandal broke. Last year, the firm hired John Imbriglia as the CEO who replaced an interim chief executive.\nSparrough did not return a request to comment. CrowdStreet declined to comment.\n",

    "content": "The debate over 485x may have died down (for now), but the fight to expand prevailing wages for construction workers is far from over.\nNearly five years ago, lawmakers\napproved\na measure that required union-level wages on private projects where public funds cover at least 30 percent of construction costs and such costs exceed $5 million. The requirements did not kick in until 2022, and the law imbued a 13-member board with the authority to raise these thresholds and to determine which programs count as public funding.\nThe Democratic majorities of the state Senate and Assembly\nwant\nto get rid of that board and increase the number of projects that must pay construction workers prevailing wages. In their budget resolutions, both chambers called for reducing the threshold to 20 percent and eliminating the Public Subsidy Board. The Assembly has also floated new dollar thresholds.\nGary LaBarbera, who heads both the city and state chapters of the Building and Construction Trades Council, is on the board but agrees that it needs to go.\nThe board was tasked with hashing out what construction projects qualify and, more fundamentally, what constitutes “construction” under the law. That, by and large, didn’t happen, according to LaBarbera.\nLaBarbera told\nThe Real Deal\nthat construction and business interests are pretty evenly split on the board, and as a result, they can’t reach a consensus. Of the 36 projects that have come before the board, the group found that prevailing wages were only required on six projects.\n“We get together four times a year to review projects,” he said. “These are two- to three-hour meetings, and all it is is a debate.”\nHe believes the legislature needs to both clarify and broaden the requirements, and that the Department of Labor should take over for the board.\nDevelopers have repeatedly opposed efforts to expand prevailing wage requirements, arguing that it drives up construction costs to the point of making projects prohibitively expensive.\nThe law spares housing projects where at least 25 percent of the units are affordable, excluding most 485x projects.\nIf prevailing wage requirements will be expanded, they’d add onto an already complex set of challenges facing developers, including stubbornly high interest rates and the prospect of tariffs driving up material costs.\nLast month, New York’s Associated Builders and Contractors\ncalled\non state lawmakers to adjust how it calculates prevailing wages, arguing that they are wrongfully inflated. The group also opposed the passage of the 2020 law, and on Wednesday an ABC representative warned that expanding these mandates would be “devastating” to the industry.\nLaBarbera says securing changes to these wage requirements is his organization’s top priority this legislative session. The group has been working to build public support for these changes,\n\nLast year, a BCTC-commissioned poll found that 77 percent of the 834 voters in New York surveyed believe developers should pay prevailing wages to construction workers on projects that receive $1 million or more in public subsidies. At the city level individual unions are also\npushing\nto require prevailing wages on more city-funded projects.\nWhat we’re thinking about\n: Global tariffs on steel and aluminum went into effect on Wednesday. How will these and other tariffs affect construction in New York? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we’ve learned\n: The New York Housing Conference, along with more than 100 lawmakers, housing groups, developers and others, sent a letter to members of the New York Congressional Delegation, urging them to reject cuts to staffing and programs at the Department of Housing Urban Development. The letter also urges the officials to support\nlegislation\nthat would lift a cap on how many private activity bonds the state can issue to finance affordable housing and that would\nincrease\nallocations of the 9 percent Low Income Housing Tax Credits.\nElsewhere in New York…\n— Mayor Eric Adams faces an uphill battle to re-election, but he says he’s almost ready to start campaigning. Adams told reporters on Tuesday that he expects to begin campaigning “very soon,”\nPolitico New York reports\n. “I’m a solid, solid campaigner. I know how to articulate a message that’s clear and crisp, and that’s what I’m going to do,” Adams said. “I’m going to enjoy every moment of selling my product to the people of this city.”\n— More than two dozen elected officials in New York, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are calling on the Department of Homeland Security to release Mahmoud Khalil,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. Khalil, a green card holder, was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Saturday for his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University. “The administration’s pattern of targeting the rights of students and immigrants to speak against injustice undermines democracy and makes everyone less safe,” the letter states. DHS agents told Khalil his green card would be revoked and his student visa canceled. A judge temporarily blocked his deportation on Monday,\n— New York is testing raw milk for bird flu,\nthe Times-Union reports\n. In January, the state issued a notice requiring monthly testing for raw milk, in addition to testing of raw milk intended for pasteurization. Bird flu has not yet been detected in cattle in New York.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Wednesday was\n$15.3 million\nfor a 3,073-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 217 West 57th Street in Times Square North. Kane Manera and Janet Want of The Corcoran Group\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$14.35 million\nfor a development site at 103 East 29th Street in Kips Bay. Impact Equities purchased the property from Auevilla Holdings.\n— Matthew Elo",

    "content": "As the Trump Administration’s tariffs rattle the S&amp;P 500 and stoke fears of recession, New York City renters are buttoning down the hatches in response to mounting uncertainty about where the economy is headed.\nThose fears are fueling record rents.\nFor the first time since\n2023\n, Manhattan’s median rent hit a fresh high of $4,500 in February, according to a report by Douglas Elliman appraiser Jonathan Miller.\nThe city’s vacancy rate slipped for the fourth-straight month to a pinched 2.4 percent and the number of bidding wars broke a record — one in four units invited such competition.\nDemand in the outer boroughs reached a similar fever pitch. The average rental price in Brooklyn topped an all-time high for the second month straight at $4,035. In Northwest Queens, rents topped $3,400, stamping the fourth increase in five months.\nThe market has tightened as tenants considering homeownership delay their decision amid an uncertain economic outlook. Mortgage rates may have slipped since President Donald Trump took office, but the administration’s erratic policy decisions have obscured projections of where the market is headed.\n\n“The economic chaos of the past couple of months negates the perception of slightly lower rates,” Miller said.\nTrump, in his first 50 days, has imposed tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada, promised higher levies, then reversed course on some of those threats.\nThe whiplash sent markets reeling; the S&amp;P 500 as of Wednesday had lost $4 trillion from its peak last month — an 8 percent decline, Reuters\nreported\n. The Nasdaq slipped 10 percent from its December peak last week, entering correction territory.\nThe Department of Government Efficiency’s cuts to the federal workforce have fueled a sense of instability, which may hold Americans back from making any big life decisions for the near future.\nThat means February’s record could be the first of many in 2025.\n“[The record] suggests that rents may set new highs this year, especially when we reach the seasonal high in the summer,” Miller said.\n",

Codes for new and rebuilt properties in high-risk fire zones now\nrequire significant measures\n, including ignition-resistant materials and multipaned or window upgrades.\n\nThe Berkeley IGS poll found broad backing for a number of policy ideas, including those that would increase taxes to pay for fire protection and build higher-density housing in urban areas.\nThe most popular proposal, with 84% support, was for policymakers to prioritize assistance for low- and middle-income families displaced by the fires.\nNearly two-thirds of voters polled wanted to provide greater funding for city and county fire departments even if that meant raising taxes.\nThe Berkeley IGS poll was conducted online in English and Spanish on Feb. 17-26 among 5,184 registered voters in L.A. County. The survey’s estimated margin of error is 2 percentage points, and larger for demographic subgroups.\nA 2019 Berkeley IGS poll\nsaw support from three-quarters of California voters\n, including 79 percent in L.A. County, for imposing limits on growth in wildfire areas, according to the Times.\nA poll last year from the Los Angeles Business Council Institute\nfound 81 percent of city voters\nbacked speeding approvals for apartment buildings with some affordable housing near public transit and existing high-density, urban areas.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Jamestown’s latest investment move in Atlanta gives it a minority stake in a key mixed-use development.\nThe firm acquired a stake in Inman Quarter, which anchors Inman Park, from TriBridge Residential, the Atlanta Business Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe 208,000-square-foot development includes 200 apartments and 40,000 square feet of retail, with restaurants like BeetleCat, MF Sushi and Bread &amp; Butterfly.\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed, but the transaction establishes a joint venture with TriBridge, which purchased Inman Quarter for $72.5 million in 2015 alongside Coro Realty Advisors. Coro later sold its stake, leaving TriBridge as the sole owner. At that time, the apartments were 90 percent leased, and the retail was about 85 percent occupied.\nA block from the Atlanta Beltline’s Eastside Trail, Inman quarter has become a popular destination, drawing about 500,000 visitors annually, according to Jamestown, citing property software company Placer.ai.\nJamestown, the firm behind major projects like Ponce City Market and Colony Square, plans to lease out vacant retail spaces and to program events to activate its courtyard.\nAtlanta’s retail market is booming, with a\nrecord-low vacancy\nrate of 3.4 percent, according to Colliers.\n\nDeveloped by JPX Works and South City Partners, Inman Quarter opened over a decade ago, coinciding with the early growth of the Beltline’s Eastside Trail and rising demand for walkable, urban living.\nThe investment reflects a broader strategy in Atlanta, where investors are targeting intown districts for redevelopment.\nRecent deals include Canvas Company’s $6.6 million acquisition of a 17-space portfolio in East Atlanta Village last month and Third &amp; Urban’s $13.75 million acquisition of more than 35,000 square feet at the Virginia-Highlands retail district in December. That deal pencils out to $393 per square foot.\nMeanwhile, New City Properties is\nadvancing its redevelopment\nof the Neuhoff meat-packing plant site, backed by $550 million from JPMorgan and Cousins Properties, adding apartments, office and retail space as part of a significant mixed-use project.\nJamestown has been expanding its footprint in Atlanta. Most recently in August, it\nacquired the local office of North American Properties\n, taking on assets like Colony Square, The Forum Peachtree Corners and Avenue East Cobb.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "Contract activity in Los Angeles County staged a comeback, with the condominium market last week leading the way out of a sluggish period.\n“This week’s report is all about condos, with our return to normal volumes being bolstered by the $48.2 million in condo contracts signed last week,” said agent Marcy Roth about the Douglas Elliman Eklund Gomes team’s weekly contracts report.\nEklund Gomes’ roundup counts listings on the MLS of $4 million or more.\nCondos, while typically commanding a large share of contracts on any given week, managed to “dominate the market,” said Roth, an Eklund Gomes team member, with an average price listing price of $9.6 million last week across five properties.\nThat compared with single-family residential’s $99.9 million in volume across 17 contracts, according to the Eklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles.\nOn an average price-per-square-foot basis, the condo segment continued to maintain its edge over single-family homes. Condos that went into contract last week had an average price per square foot of $2,277. Single-family contracts last week equated to an average of $1,344 per square foot.\nIn all, last week ended with 22 properties going into contract, totaling $148.2 million in asking dollar volume. That’s up from the slowdown of the past couple weeks, with the prior seven-day period ended March 2\nyielding 13 contracts good for $75.8 million\nin listing price volume.\nWest Hollywood’s\n8899 Beverly residences\nsaw the combined units of 7B/7E go into contract. The property is listed at just under $16 million.\n\nProperty and state records indicate the seller is a San Mateo, Calif.-registered LLC named after the building’s address.\nBrett Oppenheim of Oppenheim Real Estate holds the listing.\nThe property has three bedrooms and five bathrooms across 5,370 square feet, according to the listing. Standouts of the space include panoramic views, 11-foot sliding glass doors, wraparound balconies and over $1 million pumped into upgrades.\nLast week’s second-largest contract based on listing price was another condo, unit 2302 inside The Carlyle.\nColdwell Banker Realty’s\nJade Mills\nand Emanuele Rizzo have the listing located at 10776 West Wilshire Boulevard with a $14.5 million asking price.\nRecords show the unit was last sold in 2014, when Richard and Roselee Benaron bought the property for $7.9 million.\nThe three-bed, five-bath home in L.A.’s Westwood neighborhood is nearly 5,200 square feet and commands a half floor at the building. The unit touts views of the city and ocean, a private elevator, 10- to 12-foot ceilings and a veranda.\n",

    "content": "The push to get public employees back to offices in Chicago is being led by the private sector — and landlords anxious to resuscitate the streets of the Loop aren’t getting much help from City Hall.\nThe Building Owners and Managers Association of Chicago is lobbying Mayor Brandon Johnson to take a clearer stance on the subject and the Chicago Loop Alliance is leading by example, having called its staff back to the office five days a week at the start of the year.\nBut there isn’t much political pressure being levied at City Hall, as downtown aldermen are staying quiet for now. Aldermen who represent the Loop — the 42nd Ward’s Brendan Reilly and Lamont Robinson of the 4th Ward — didn’t respond to requests for comment. Alderman Bill Conway, who also represents part of the Loop, declined to comment.\nThat leaves the industry on its own, with Farzin Parang, head of BOMA in Chicago, trying to rally allies by tying the cause to other concerns of the mayor’s constituents. Elsewhere, mayors are taking the lead on the issue. Most recently, San Francisco\nMayor Daniel Lurie\nordered city desk workers to return to the office at least four days per week by April 28.\n“We urge the mayor to promote a downtown return across all sectors and support policies that boost office occupancy, including reducing the reliance on property tax and improving public transit,” Parang said.\nThe impact of any additional in-office days for government workers could be significant. The City of Chicago alone employs about 10,000 people at offices, with many located in the Loop. Cook County has another 9,000 or so desk employees in the city, and the State of Illinois accounts for thousands more.\nExpecting office occupancy to reach pre-pandemic levels in any city is a stretch, but an influx of thousands of more workers on any given day could have a ripple effect on struggling retailers and support multifamily development, industry insiders say.\nA concerted effort by public sector leadership would supplement the private sector’s push, which has notched some gains for the area but leaves plenty of room for improvement, said John Vance of Chicago retail brokerage Stone Street Real Estate.\n“It would be unfair and wrong to blame the struggles of the Loop on just city of Chicago employees or state of Illinois employees who work in Chicago,” he said. “But they are working for an employer who has a vested interest in making sure that the city of Chicago, and therefore the state of Illinois, does well.”\nWhere RTO policies stand now\nOffice policies across all levels of government in Chicago vary and can be subject to any of the dozens of union contracts dictating certain terms for employers. Representatives of the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois did not respond to repeated requests for comment about work-from-home policies.\nA representative of Cook County said all county employees must work in office at least three days per week. Employees can, however, request exceptions to the schedule from the human resources chief. The county didn’t return a request for the number of exemptions granted.\nAs of January, government office use in Chicago is at 73 percent of pre-pandemic levels according to an Avison Young analysis.\nWith over 48,000 employees, the federal government is the largest employer in the city of Chicago. But tracking various agencies’ office policies is complicated by the current presidential administration’s expansive effort to lay off workers and cut office space by as much as 50 percent.\n\n“These reductions, including the recent planned disposal of the SEC lease at 175 West Jackson Boulevard, could mean a busier government footprint in Chicago, but also a smaller one,” Avison analyst Sean Boyd said.\nThe LaSalle-Wacker corridor, a retail submarket that includes many government buildings and law firms, is one of the lowest performing in the Loop with a 36 percent retail vacancy rate in 2024, Stone Street Real Estate found.\n“[Retailers] need the streets to have a vibrancy and energy and people feeling good because there is a healthy buzz that people create when they are physically here,” Stone Street Real Estate’s Vance said.\nOther areas of the Loop bordering the West Loop and River North have had a faster recovery.\n“Chicago is recovering very unevenly, and if a segment of office that is concentrated recovers dramatically, it’s going to have a huge immediate impact on that submarket,” said Greg Kirsch, founder of retail brokerage Kirsch Agency.\nSeeking other solutions\nMultifamily development also plays a key role in the Loop’s recovery.\nIncreasing its full-time residents will improve retail traffic on evenings and weekends, create easier commutes for some workers and diversify the tax base, said Rob Karr, CEO of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association.\nKarr’s organization isn’t fully on board with requiring in-office schedules; Stone Street Real Estate recently studied three boutique retail corridors through North Side neighborhoods that are flourishing, with little to no vacancy on stretches of Damen, Southport and Armitage avenues.\n“While it’s important we find ways to bring shoppers and workers back downtown throughout the week, we don’t support in-office mandates as no one approach fits the needs of all employers and employees,” Karr said. “It will take collaboration between the business community and policymakers to find creative ways to make downtown a destination once again.”\nA transformation is already underway. Between 2000 and 2022, the Loop’s population grew by 154 percent, according to the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. Meanwhile, the total population of Chicago declined by 6 percent during the same time period.\nIf the city’s plan to subsidize\noffice-to-multifamily conversions on LaSalle Street\nsucceeds, it will add to the Loop’s residential growth trajectory; developer\nMike Reschke\non Wednesday won Chicago City Council approval for the conversion of five floors of vacant former office space at 208 South LaSalle into 168 apartments with up to $26 million in tax increment financing support from the city, one of several such projects moving forward in the area.\n“The ultimate survival of the Loop as an office destination is going to happen because people live there,” Kirsch said. “There are other markets in the country that have less residential use and they’re going to have a harder time recovering.”\n",

    "content": "A law firm lease will bring Hines’ Texas Tower to 99 percent leased.\nSkadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom leased 52,000 square feet spanning two full floors at 845 Texas Avenue, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The lease will begin in April 2026, but the terms weren’t otherwise disclosed.\nThe deal leaves just 18,000 square feet available in the 47-story, 1.2 million-square-foot tower, which is co-owned by Houston-based Hines and Ivanhoe Cambridge. Savills’ Mark O’Donnell represented the tenant, and Michael Anderson of Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented the landlords.\nThe lease follows Hines’\nlanding a rare $450 million refinancing\nearlier this month, marking the first time in two years a multi-tenant office tower outside New York City was financed through the CMBS single-asset, single-borrower market.\nSkadden will move from its 24,000-square-foot space at 1000 Louisiana Street, Wells Fargo Plaza.\nThat 71-story tower was built in 1983. Its owner, MetLife, plans to spend $138,000 to remodel its 900-square-foot\namenity space\nfor an arcade game room to lure tenants after adding a golf simulator last year. It is also adding a restaurant, bar and tenant lounge, according to the building’s website.\nTexas Tower opened in 2021 and is among the city’s most leased Class A office towers. Other tenants, with Hines’ global headquarters, include law firms Vinson &amp; Elkins, Clifford Chance and DLA Piper as well as Cheniere Energy, Morgan Stanley and coworking space The Square.\n\nThe tower includes two restaurants managed by Berg Hospitality Group. The Sylvie, a French bistro, opened last year. Seafood restaurant Dune Road was set to open last year but hasn’t yet delivered.\nIt also features amenities like underfloor air conditioning, private terraces and a 9,600-square-foot amenity center with a lounge and conference space.\nThe tower’s leasing success highlights the “flight-to-quality” trend, Hines senior managing director John Mooz said.\nClass A inventory has tightened in the city as tenants opt to lease where amenities are enticing enough to lure and retain workers. Older buildings have suffered as a result. The office vacancy rate remains high; it was up to 25.7 percent in the fourth quarter, according to CoStar.\nHouston’s office pipeline has 1.9 million square feet of space under development, about tied with Los Angeles as of January, according to data from CommercialEdge cited by\nCommercialCafe\n. Dallas has 2.8 million square feet underway, and Austin has 3.6 million, the second-most in the nation behind Boston.\nThe drop in office output from previous years across southern markets will likely have a positive effect on occupancy rates, especially as more employers initiate return-to-office mandates, the site said.\n— Judah Duke\n",

As a whole, the project’s overall square footage remains the same, as BH3 added more units but decreased the average unit size. The commercial space also was scaled down to 12,200 square feet from 72,200 square feet.\nThe Development Review Committee evaluated the new proposal at its meeting on Tuesday. Next, BH3 will incorporate feedback from the committee and the city’s planning department into its site plan, which will be filed to the city, according to a source familiar with the process. City commissioners will have a final say on the changes at a yet unscheduled meeting.\nBH3 hasn’t yet decided if the units will be condos or apartments, according to the source.\n\nThe DNA project has been in the works since at least 2022. Records show BH3 owns the development site, having paid $23.1 million for it in 2019.\nBH3\n–– led by co-founders Daniel Lebensohn and Gregory Freedman and executive chairman Eric Edidin –– is a real estate development firm.

The commercial space spans 3,615 square feet.\nGoldstein, an Auschwitz concentration camp survivor according to published reports, bought the storefront in 2015 for $10 million, partially financing the purchase with a $6.3 million mortgage from New York Community Bank, records show. Last year, the financial institution rebranded as Flagstar Bank.\nGoldstein and Flagstar Bank’s lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nGoldstein’s entity bought the commercial units from Aldo Shoes, which leased back the property until 2020, when the shoe retailer moved out. The space has been vacant since the landlord placed the units on the market in December with an undisclosed asking price. The storefront is being marketed by Miami Beach-based\nInHouse Commercial Sales\n.\nGoldstein’s entity allegedly defaulted on the loan by allegedly missing payments since January, as well as failing to pay property insurance and property taxes, the complaint alleges.

    "content": "In a scheme spanning several years, a Florida resident allegedly orchestrated a fraudulent takeover of a low-income housing cooperative in Brooklyn, stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars while leaving the building in financial distress.\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James\nfiled a lawsuit\nyesterday against Jessica Vargas for falsely claiming control over the Housing Development Fund Corporation at 13 Scholes Street in Williamsburg. The building was established in 1996 as affordable housing for low-income New Yorkers.\nAccording to investigators, the scheme began after all original resident shareholders of the cooperative had passed away. Vargas, the daughter of a former shareholder, allegedly exploited the situation, despite having no legal claim to the property.\nAlthough Vargas was once the administrator of her late father’s estate, it never contained any assets related to the building and was closed in 2021. Despite this, Vargas began representing herself as the cooperative’s president, secretary, treasurer and sole shareholder.\nTo solidify her fraudulent control, Vargas allegedly created false stock certificates and filed misleading ownership information with city agencies. She then established an invalid lease agreement with a private company, through which she collected at least $442,000 in rent payments that should have gone to the cooperative.\n\nWhile diverting these funds for personal use, Vargas neglected the building’s financial obligations, according to the complaint, failing to pay over $40,000 in property taxes and more than $3,000 in water bills. This left the once-stable affordable housing cooperative in significant debt.\nVargas then attempted to sell the entire building to generate additional personal profit, despite having no legal right to do so, according to the complaint.\nAttorney General James is seeking to remove Vargas from her fraudulently claimed position, ban her from conducting any business related to the property and recover the misappropriated funds.\n“Jessica Vargas declared herself president of a building she had no claim to, exploiting New Yorkers for her personal gain while living over a thousand miles away,” James said in a statement. “What was meant to be affordable housing for New Yorkers has now been manipulated into a Floridian’s personal piggy bank. That is unacceptable.”\n",

Terms of the deal, as well as any brokers involved in the transaction, were not disclosed.\nThe Roya complex is expected to benefit from a tailwind of strong demand, mainly due to its walkable location within central Los Angeles and nearby shopping options, according to Tom Burns, managing director for Affinius.\n“The property has already been well received by the market, and we expect it to continue to perform,” he told CO.\nThe Roya, 3.8 miles west of Downtown Los Angeles, has 157 studios, and one- and two-bedroom apartments. The complex has a resident lounge, coworking areas, a fitness center, karaoke room, pool deck and spa and a roof deck with fire pits.\nJamison Services, founded in 2006 by Dr. David Lee, is among the largest multifamily investors in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Jamison family of companies has $3 billion in assets under management, including 18 million square feet of commercial and medical office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use properties, according to its website.\nWithin the past year, the firm has hit financial headwinds.\nIn December, a 163,170-square-foot office complex owned by Jamison Properties at 16530 Ventura Boulevard in Encino was\nheaded toward receivership\n,\nThe Real Deal\nreported.\nA month earlier, a  $35.4 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan tied to a 340,000-square-foot office building owned by Jamison at 811 Wilshire Boulevard in Downtown was\nsent to special servicing\n, according to\nTRD\n.\nAt the same time, Koreatown’s biggest office landlord\ndefaulted on an $86.5 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan\ntied to a 34-story office tower at 3435 Wilshire Boulevard, in Koreatown.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "An offbeat home sale in Deerfield shows there’s always appetite for a slice of something different.\nThe suburb’s famous “pie house,” named for its wedge-shaped design, sold for its $350,000 asking price, $55,000 more than it asked\ntwo years ago\n, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nThe 1,100-square-foot home gained national fame in August 2020 when a TikToker pointed out its triangular design. It has since earned sporadic media attention, including a shout-out from Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show.”\nBuilt in 2003, the home’s unusual shape was a necessity born from its 0.09-acre lot. It initially drew some complaints from neighbors but later became a local curiosity. The house has an unconventional design despite appearing fairly traditional from the front, with its seven windows and a door. A view from the side reveals a wall only 3 feet wide, from which the remaining walls extend outward at an acute angle, like a slice of pie.\nIt was developed by Greg Weissman, then-owner of Advantage Properties, now a broker for @properties Christie’s International Real Estate in Northbrook. It has finally hit above the $325,000 price point\nWeissman hoped to sell it for in 2003\n.\nIt hit the market in September, finding a buyer just two days later.\n\nThe buyer was Tanaka Littlepaige, a manager at the world’s largest derivatives exchange, Chicago-based CME Group, according to county records.\nThe seller was Abigail Drazner, an operations project manager at insurance and financial services firm Alera Group, who bought the home in 2020. For a few months in 2020 it was listed as a short-term rental, offering free pizza for the first booker.\nTed Pickus and Lisa Schulkin had the listing, and Beth Wexler represented Littlepaige, all agents with @properties Christie’s.\nThe two-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom house includes 9-foot ceilings, hardwood floors, stainless steel appliances and a paver brick walkway. It also features a storage shed and a parking pad that accommodates up to four cars, though it lacks a garage. The home has one bedroom upstairs and another in the basement.\nThe property has changed hands multiple times over the years, with the latest sale price comfortably topping its 2021 price of $295,000. Previous sale prices included $300,000 in 2004, $284,500 in 2007, and $260,000 in 2020. Its property taxes for 2023 were $8,014.\n— Judah Duke\n",

Horton picked up a 30-acre parcel along Davis Road in League City, according to a news release from Colliers.\nThe seller was Houston-based Broad Reach Capital, deed records show. Colliers’ Chris Hutcheson, Harrison Kane and James Kadlick represented Broad Reach Capital.\nThe purchase came on the heels of a\ntender offer\nfrom Forestar. The company offered shareholders cash to purchase outstanding 3.85 percent senior notes due. Forestar received offers for 83 percent of the notes, amounting to $329.4 million.\nOther big names in development have also been turning dirt for single-family development in League City.\nHillwood Communities started construction on Legacy by Hillwood, between Interstate 45 and FM 528, a year ago. It was the Dallas-based developer’s third community in the Houston area.\n\nAt full build-out, the 805-acre community will feature 1,600 homes, an elementary school and amenities like pools, a recreation center and launch areas for kayaks and paddleboards.\nLike other far-flung suburbs of major Texas cities, League City is experiencing a wave of growth. In 15 years, its population has nearly tripled to 122,000 people; 40 percent of the city is still undeveloped.\nThe city is preparing for an influx of development with drainage improvements to address flooding and by upgrading the League City waterline, which comes from Houston.\nForestar sold more than 15,000 residential lots last year. The company operates in 24 states, according to its website, but its focus is on communities in the Sunbelt. D. R. Horton acquired a majority stake in Forestar in 2017.\n",

Brokers Michael Haenel, Andy Markham and Phil Haenel of Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented EQT Exeter.\nThe renter will use the two-year-old building for warehousing and distribution across the western U.S.\nIn August, Kenco and a division of British Petroleum won\npermission to store petroleum products\nat a 168,000-square-foot facility in Surprise, about 22 miles northwest of Phoenix.\nIn April, EQT Exeter bought the Buckeye warehouse now known as I-10 Gateway for $60.1 million, or $94 per square foot.\nThe Southwest Valley’s industrial submarket “is really, really favorable and attracting a lot of high-quality, national tenants,” Scott Guo, investment and leasing officer for EQT Exeter, told the Business Journal.\n\nHe said large firms such as Kenco are looking to either relocate from California’s Inland Empire, the heart of the Western U.S. industrial distribution market, or are looking to expand their footprints.\nProximity to California ports was “really important for these guys,” Guo said, while the Buckey warehouse’s direct access to Interstate 10 was a “very, very big competitive advantage when they were weighing other buildings that they could have otherwise leased.”\nAcross all submarkets, the Southwest Valley outside Phoenix had the\nmost industrial square footage\ncompleted or under construction in the fourth quarter, according to CBRE.\nSome 87 percent of the 3.2 million square feet of industrial warehouses completed last quarter was in the southwest region. At the same time, 9.7 million square feet were under construction, or 61 percent of the 15.9 million square feet being built across greater Phoenix.\nEQT Exeter, founded in 2006 as Exeter Property Group, has more than $30 billion in assets under management, including more than 2,000 properties and 375 million square feet of warehouses, office and life sciences buildings and homes, according to its website.\nIn early 2021, Swedish private equity manager EQT AB acquired Exeter Property Group and renamed it EQT Exeter, which serves as its real estate arm.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "The Trump administration’s anti-DEI crusade is hitting affordable housing groups across the country.\nAfter a review by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, millions of dollars of federal contracts in the sector were canceled, Bloomberg\nreported\n. DOGE staff determined which contracts to cut by searching nonprofit websites and LinkedIn pages for terms associated with diversity, equity and inclusion.\nThe contracts were cut in February after DOGE directed the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to inform nonprofits if they were “not in compliance with the Executive Order titled ‘Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing.’”\nProjects in more than 1,000 communities were affected by the canceled contracts. The projects involved addressing homelessness, disaster recovery, persistent poverty and more housing issues.\nAt least eight national organizations saw technical assistance contracts canceled, taking away grants for consulting on tools, coordination and systems. Two of the three groups that administer Section 4 — which provides support for capacity-building and community development and requires recipients to “advance housing justice” and “support underserved communities,” according to HUD — had awards eliminated too.\nThe nonprofit\nLocal Initiatives Support Corporation\nhad all of its technical assistance and Section 4 awards canceled, according to the organization. The $30 million in lost contracts included providing first-time homebuyer support in the Mississippi Delta to local teachers.\n\nEnterprise Community Partners, a national nonprofit\nrun by former HUD secretary Shaun Donovan\n, had four contracts canceled, including a $32 million reward under Section 4, for which the nonprofit would redistribute funds to groups that build and preserve affordable housing.\nDonovan said the cuts “will raise costs for families, hobble the creation of affordable homes, forfeit local jobs, and sap opportunity from thousands of communities in all 50 states.”\nThe third group that administers Section 4, Habitat for Humanity, did not appear to be affected by the cuts; its website describes the group as a nonprofit ecumenical Christian organization.\nWhile HUD acquiesced to the cuts, the agency said it was planning to allow appeals and is now communicating that process with grantees.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Spanning 8,700 square feet on less than a quarter acre, it sold then for about $931 per square foot, and now for about $667 per square foot.\nThe sellers listed it\n14 months after they bought it for $8.2 million\n, but price cuts over time brought the asking price down to $6.39 million.\nThe property went under contract in February and closed last week. The sellers’ names are hidden behind a land trust.\nThe buyers, not yet revealed in public records, were represented by Compass agents Eudice Fogel and Jayme Slate. Emily Sachs Wong of @properties Christie’s International Real Estate had the listing.\nThe sale price still ranks as the seventh-highest for a Chicago-area home so far this year.\n\nIt includes a four-car garage, elevator, rooftop deck with a metal pergola and a walled courtyard.\nA highlight is the staircase, designed as a modern homage to the iconic metal staircase legendary Chicago architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe created for the Arts Club. Lohan, the home’s architect, is Mies’ grandson.\nLohan designed the house for lumber scion Harry Seigle, who sold his family’s lumber and home supply business in 2005 for $121 million. The architect is known for designing prominent structures like the former\nMcDonald’s headquarters in Oak Brook\nand the Shedd Aquarium’s Abbott Oceanarium.\nOthers among Chicago’s top home sales so far this year include a Gold Coast penthouse at Elm &amp; State that sold for over $10 million. It was previously owned by former Fortune Brands CEO Bruce Carbonari. In Winnetka, two $12 million homes\nsold last week\nin addition to a\n$35 million mansion at 419 Sheridan Road\n, sold by former Goldman Sachs partner Muneer Satter in February.\nLuxury homes in Chicago often sell for less than their last transaction.

    "content": "Russell Galbut’s GFO Investments plans a 410-unit Live Local Act apartment project in Miami-Dade County, as developers seize on the state affordable housing law.\nMiami-based GFO, the Galbut family’s office, proposes a 19-story building and a 16-story building with a seven-story, 950-space garage podium, and a seven-story medical office building on a 4.1-acre site at 7350 Coral Way in an unincorporated area of the county, according to an application filed to Miami-Dade last week. The neighborhood is known as Coral Terrace.\nDr. Jorge Perez, whose specialties include neonatology and neonatal medicine, and his team are partnering on the project and will lease the medical office building, Galbut said. Perez lists affiliations with Baptist Health South Florida and Kidz Medical Services.\n“Housing is desperately needed in the area,” Galbut said.\nAn entity tied to Perez owns the site, records show. GFO also has an ownership stake in the property, which is a former Miami-Dade police shooting range, Galbut said.\nThe project, called Park Residences, will include 90,000 square feet of medical office and retail space. The apartment towers will consist of studios, as well as one- to three-bedroom units, the application shows.\n\nThe 19-story building will have 164 apartments at workforce rents, representing 40 percent of all 410 units, as is required under the\nLive Local Act\n, the application shows. They will be reserved for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income.\nMiami-Dade’s annual AMI is $79,400, according to the Florida Housing Finance Corporation. To qualify for one of the workforce apartments, a one-person household can earn up to $95,400, a two-person household can earn up to $108,960 and a three-person household can earn up to $122,520.\nGFO, through an affiliate, filed a request to Miami-Dade for a pre-application meeting. Pre-application meetings generally are requested to gauge county staff’s input on a proposal before an official application is submitted.\nIf approved, Park Residences is expected to be completed in two to three years, according to Galbut.\nMiami-based\nGFO’s\nprojects include the 51-story short-term rental-friendly condo tower,\nGale Miami Hotel &amp; Residences\n, which was completed last year at 601 Northeast First Avenue in downtown Miami. Last summer, GFO launched sales for the 32-story, 283-unit short-term rental condo tower\n14 Roc\nat 125 Northeast 14th Street in Miami’s Arts &amp; Entertainment District.\nGalbut also co-leads Miami-based Crescent Heights. Last year, the firm scored Miami Beach project review board approval for a\nfour-story retail\nbuilding at 1901 Alton Road.\n",

    "content": "The owners of scores of torched homes from Altadena to the Pacific Palisades are cashing out.\nA forecast landslide of listings related to the January firestorms that burned more than\n12,000 homes\nin Los Angeles County has picked up speed,\nthe Los Angeles Times reported\n.\nIn late January, the first vacant lot was put up for sale in Altadena. Then more than a dozen lots were listed last month in the Pacific Palisades for\nbetween $2 million and $8 million\n, with the first lot closing at $1.2 million.\nNow the floodgates appear to have opened, according to the Times. Owners of blackened lots are increasingly choosing to sell rather than slog through the time-consuming and costly task of rebuilding.\n“There [are] so many to choose from,” Jeremy Hardy, a broker with Craig Estates &amp; Fine Properties, told the Times.\nAs of early Monday, there were 49 burned lots listed in Pacific Palisades, and 32 up for sale in Altadena, according to Zillow.\nThe reasons for choosing to sell are varied, real estate agents say. Some owners don’t think they have the money to rebuild, while others are aging and don’t want their last years tied up with construction.\n\nSome with rental properties concluded that keeping them wasn’t worth the hassle.\nMost of those interested in acquiring the burned lots are developers, agents say. Builders generally have the cash to buy vacant land. They can also put up with time, aggravation and costs associated with construction.\n“Building a house is one of the most complex and highly regulated activities you possibly can engage in,” Brock Harris, a Keller Williams agent with the first scorched lot listing in Altadena, which sold to a builder, told the Times.\nA rush by developers could help neighborhoods build back quicker.\nThey’re also raising concerns about gentrification and whether longtime owners are getting a fair price for their lots. In\nmiddle-class Altadena\n, residents proclaimed, “Altadena is not for sale.”\nAt least eight burned lots have been sold in the area with most selling for between $500,000 and $600,000, according to Zillow. Agents said the lots are going for two-thirds of what the typical land fetched before the fire.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, which walked away rather than pay the tab for the beleaguered Westfield San Francisco Centre mall, wants to sell the office buildings next door for housing.\nThe French conglomerate is about to list the 77,000-square-foot building at 814 Mission Street and the 28,000-square-foot building at 818 Mission Street near Union Square for an undisclosed price,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported\n.\nNearly 20 years ago, Westfield bought the side-by-side buildings between Jessie and Fourth streets for a combined $42 million, or $400 per square foot.\nThe vacant buildings are set to hit the market this month, and could sell for less than half their last traded price. Recent office sales in the area have reset the market at between\n$100 to $200 per square foot\n.\n“Pricing will be in line with other office buildings that have recently sold in Mid-Market,” broker Darren Kuiper of Colliers, working to sell the buildings for Westfield, told the Chronicle. The  listing is shared by brokers Tony Crossley and Robert Gilley of Colliers, and Bruce Carlson of Kennedy Wilson.\nKuiper said Westfield hired Chicago-based SOM to evaluate the combined sites for redevelopment into housing, saying that under current density bonus laws, a 365-foot tower with 400 units was possible.\nBrokers said the Mission Street buildings can be sold separately or together and could be paired with the former Westfield mall next door,\nnow operated by a receiver\n. Its foreclosure auction was\ncanceled last month\nand is now slated for March 27.\nIt was in June 2023 that Paris-based Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield and New York-based Brookfield Properties abandoned the city’s largest mall rather than pay its $558 million mortgage loan.\n\nThe owners of the nine-story, 1.5 million-square-foot mall with 170 stores at 865 Market Street pointed to a plunge in shoppers and sales post-pandemic.\nAt the same time, Seattle-based Nordstrom was poised to pull out of the half-empty mall, citing “unsafe conditions” for leaving a\n312,000-square-foot\nhole.\nThe part of downtown surrounding the mall has been\nchallenged\nwith quality-of-life and safety issues in the wake of the pandemic. A Denny’s on the ground floor of 818 Mission for nearly two decades\nclosed last year\n, adding to its vacant storefronts.\nA purchase of the vacant offices owned by Westfield would be a long-term play, brokers say.\nDespite the area’s challenges, it has “a lot of great infrastructure,” Carlson of Kennedy Wilson told the Chronicle, highlighting nearby parking, bus and BART stations, museums and the Moscone Convention Center. “The bones are there.”\n“The question is, are people OK with grabbing a big site like this and then waiting?” Kuiper of Colliers posed to the newspaper. “Because it may take five-plus years for the development world to come back, maybe longer.\n“But there are not a lot of high-rise opportunities in this kind of location with the ability for the builder to go really tall and do housing.”\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

They’ll operate out of the company’s Fort Lauderdale office at 2201 Prospect Road. Charles Rutenberg Realty has about 1,200 agents.\nMichael Brownwell, founder of Real Estate Authority, will stay on as talent attraction specialist, focused on recruiting, according to a release.\n\nUnited Real Estate is active in 34 states and has more than 22,000 agents across the country. It was involved in deals totaling $26.3 billion in dollar volume last year, according to the release.\nThe merger is another sign of increased consolidation in the brokerage business, in part due to thinning margins.\nIn South Florida, eXp Realty\nrecently acquired\na 102-agent brokerage in Miami called OnePath Realty, and the 500-agent Aventura-based firm called Broker’s LLC. Locally, brokerages have been expanding beyond Miami-Dade and even the tri-county region, which has become more saturated.\nThe Keyes Family of Companies, which includes the Keyes Co. and Illustrated Properties, is the largest independently owned brokerage in the state with more than 3,000 agents.

    "content": "Howard Lutnick may have the president’s ear, but some in the administration and around Donald Trump are coming for his head.\nThe Commerce Secretary and former Cantor Fitzgerald head is bearing the blame for the tariff situation embroiling the nation, Politico\nreported\n. Lutnick is drawing increasing frustration from administration officials and Trump allies alike due to his close proximity with the president and economic counsel.\nLutnick hasn’t helped matters by seemingly overstepping on a number of occasions, sometimes contradicting the White House’s planned messaging. For instance, Lutnick said on “Meet the Press” that Americans should “absolutely not” brace for a recession, even though a taped interview where Trump refused to rule out the potential of a recession was about to air.\nHe also hinted on CNBC about a potential pause in\ntariffs\nfor Canada and Mexico while the administration was still negotiating with the countries.\n“He’s trying to be a mini-Trump. I don’t think he got the memo that only Trump gets to be Trump,” an administration source told Politico. “It just reinforces that he doesn’t really know how to do the job.”\n\nA White House spokesperson defended Lutnick as “an integral addition to the Trump administration’s trade and economic team,” pointing to the February jobs report as a feather in his cap. Lutnick did not comment.\nIt’s unclear if Trump is feeling the same frustration towards Lutnick that his allies are, given that  the latter joined the president on Air Force One over the weekend.\nBut it wasn’t long ago when Lutnick fell out of favor with others in Trump’s orbit during the transition, which Lutnick co-chaired. His control of the information flow to the president-elect reportedly\ndampened his chances\nto be Treasury Secretary.\nThe Dow fell substantially on both Monday and Tuesday as economic uncertainty ruled, along with a switch regarding tariffs on Canadian goods being flipped on and off at a nauseating pace. Lutnick helped negotiate a deal with Ontario Premier Doug Ford to suspend a threatened tariff on energy exports.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

It is the first major office building to open downtown since\nHines’ Texas Tower\nin 2021.\nHicks Johnson signed for a 13-year lease on the 19th floor of the tower in September. The buildout — including offices, meeting rooms and a mock courtroom — will begin this summer and wrap in the fall. Houston-based Kirksey Architecture is designing the space with O’Donnell/Snider Construction as general contractor.\nThe 28-story building is 50 percent leased between Hicks Johnson, Norton Rose Fulbright and\nBoston Consulting Group\n. The remaining space is being marketed to tenants looking for modern, amenity-rich office environments downtown.\n\nThe building has 375,000 square feet of office space and 7,000 square feet of ground-floor retail. It features three landscaped terraces and a 9,600-square-foot amenity center with lounge areas, a bar and conference space.\nThe move aligns with the firm’s plan to double its headcount from 20 to 40 lawyers over the next five years, Managing Partner Andrew Hicks said.\nThe firm is exiting TC Energy Center, at 700 Louisiana Street, whose ownership includesM-M Properties and an affiliate of the General Electric Pension Trust. It was built in 1983, and buildings of that era contribute the largest share of vacancy in Houston. Buildings constructed in the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s average about 30 percent vacant, while those built since 2010 have an average vacancy under 14 percent as tenants seek new buildings with amenities to attract workers.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "A historic Upper East Side townhouse just logged a price chop.\nThe property at 4 East 80th Street, known as the Woolworth Mansion, is asking just under $50 million — down roughly $10 million from its asking price when it hit the market in November, according to a listing on Realtor.com.\nIt’s a far cry from the\n$90 million\nthe sellers, the family of the late fitness mogul Lucille Roberts, sought when it listed in 2011, though the home hasn’t been offered for sale in more than a decade.\nThe discount comes as another Gilded Age mansion located one block away\nfound a buyer\nafter four years on the market. The townhouse at 973 Fifth Avenue landed a signed contract last month, just two weeks after the listing broker, Corcoran’s Carrie Chiang, lowered the asking price to $50 million.\nListing broker Adam Modlin of the Modlin Group said the Woolworth Mansion was the “best value” for a home of its size following the nearby sale, where he brought the buyer. He noted that the asking price works out to about $2,500 per square foot.\nRoberts, who founded a chain of all-women gyms, and her husband, commercial real estate investor Bob Roberts, bought the Woolworth Mansion for $6 million in 1995 from the Young Men’s Philanthropic League. The couple spent years restoring the home before Lucille’s death in 2003.\n\nThe Roberts family first tried to offload the property in 2011. Listed it for $90 million, the sprawling 20,000-square-foot mansion was the most expensive home on the market, and if it had sold for that price, would have made the priciest townhouse sale in New York City history.\nBut a deal never materialized, and the family pulled the townhouse off the market two years later. Before they stopped shopping the property, a disgruntled former employee of Lucille’s gyms was suspected of\nvandalizing the home\nin 2012 by throwing white paint on its exterior and shooting it with BB pellets.\nKevin Roberts, Bob and Lucille’s son, told the\nWall Street Journal\nhe lived in the home with his father until 2016. Bob left a few years later and now lives between the Hamptons and Palm Beach. The Roberts found a renter for the home in 2021 for $80,000 per month.\nFrank Woolworth, who made his fortune from “Five-and-Dime” stores, commissioned the Charles P.H. Gilbert-designed townhouse for his daughter, Helena Woolworth McCann, in 1915. He also had two adjacent homes built for his other children, all of which once formed a compound with his nearby property until it was demolished in the 1920s.\nThe 35-foot-wide mansion spans seven stories and has nine bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and three kitchens. The home’s interior includes a mosaic floor, stained glass skylight, molding and a wood-paneled dining room fit for 50 people. It also features a gym, library, elevator, solarium and sauna.\n",

    "content": "Another historic office tower in downtown Chicago could soon join the city’s wave of residential conversions.\nAn investor group led by Tom Liravongsa has proposed converting the vacant office space in the Pittsfield Building into 214 residential units, Crain’s\nreported\n, citing a zoning application.\nLiravongsa, an investor based in Grand Rapids, Michigan,\nacquired 30 of the building’s 40 floors\nthrough a foreclosure sale in April 2023. His investment firm is L’Cre Global.\nThe conversion plan is aimed at upper office floors of the building at 55 East Washington Street, leaving untouched the 177 apartments already owned by Marc Realty on floors 13 to 21. Marc Realty has authorized the zoning application so long as the existing residential units remain unaffected. The building was the city’s tallest when it was constructed in 1927.\nIt would be the latest conversion in a trend that’s touched underutilized downtown office properties as the city grapples with remote work-driven office vacancies and\nstrong residential rental demand\n.\nOther projects in the pipeline, which have won city approval, include Campari Group’s conversion of\n79 West Monroe Street\n, two New York developers’\nplans for the Lightner Building\nat 1006 South Michigan Avenue, and Riverside Investment &amp; Development, DL3 Realty and AmTrust RE’s\nconversion at 135 South LaSalle Street\n.\n\nReviving the iconic Pittsfield Building will require overcoming a tight lending environment and the complexities of redeveloping historic properties.\nBesides that, the building is at the center of a\nlegal battle\nbetween a developer and the city.\n​​The building’s former owner, Miami-based Morgan Reed Group, filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and later sued the city, alleging that illegal downzoning stripped the property of value. The case was\nrecently set for trial\n.\nFurther complicating the building’s history, Chinese-Canadian investor Xiao Hua “Edward” Gong purchased Morgan Reed’s stake during bankruptcy proceedings but faced securities fraud charges in Canada, which froze his assets and stalled redevelopment.\nGong eventually\ndropped his yearslong lawsuit\ncontesting the foreclosure sale in November.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "Steve Croman’s multifamily portfolio is starting to show cracks.\nDalan Management is moving to foreclose on the controversial landlord after buying a pool of loans backing his buildings several months ago.\nThe Wrublin family’s firm filed lawsuits Tuesday seeking to foreclose on four of Croman’s properties that have debt totaling $27.5 million. The move comes after Dalan purchased a\n$140 million portfolio\nof the landlord’s loans from Axos Bank in October — and adds to Croman’s woes.\nHe recently\nlost a yearslong battle\nfor control of a Kips Bay property when Maverick Real Estate Partners took over the building in a foreclosure sale in November.\nCroman, who went to jail for mortgage fraud and earned a reputation as one of the city’s worst landlords for harassing tenants, has a large multifamily portfolio spread across Manhattan. These foreclosure cases could hint at more distress across his holdings.\nRepresentatives for Croman and Dalan could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe largest of the properties in the Dalan action is the 48-unit 20-22 Prince Street in NoLita, which Croman bought in 2006 for just shy of $9 million. He took out a $13.75 million mortgage with Axos Bank in 2019.\n\nThe other properties are 221 Mott Street in NoLita (with a $5.75 million loan), 420-424 West 51st Street in Hell’s Kitchen ($4.65 million) and 1978-1982 Third Avenue in East Harlem ($3.35 million).\nCroman defaulted on the loans when they matured in 2023 and 2024, according to Dalan’s lawsuit. Court filings also say that the landlord defaulted on a $31 million backing a townhouse at 12 East 72nd Street, though it doesn’t appear a foreclosure case has been filed on that property.\nCroman bought the empty, six-story building in 2022 and reportedly had plans to convert its 23 apartments into a single mansion, though it’s not clear what — if anything — ever came of the plans.\nThe foreclosure cases come after a protracted battle Croman had with Maverick. Croman defaulted on a\n$23 million loan\nbacking  208-214 East 25th Street in Kips Bay in 2021, and his lender — Miami-based BankUnited — sold the loan to David Aviram and Ted Martell’s debt investment firm.\nCroman fought foreclosure and even threw the property into bankruptcy, claiming he was the victim of a predatory lending scheme.\nMaverick took over the property at a foreclosure auction in November.\n",

    "content": "Hoque Global moved the needle on its ambitious University Hills mixed-use development in Southern Dallas, gaining momentum for the delayed project.\nThe Dallas-based firm executed a development agreement with the city for the 270-acre site, and it now has 60 days to buy the land, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe Dallas City Council\napproved amendments to the development agreement\nin December, extending deadlines and increasing the public subsidy to $35.9 million. The firm’s minimum investment requirement rose to $62 million, and it was tasked with selling an additional 50 lots to third-party builders.\nHoque must purchase the site by May 12 and secure construction funding by August 10. Arthur Santa-Maria, vice president at Hoque, said the firm is on track.\nUniversity Hills, near the University of North Texas at Dallas and Interstate 20, is envisioned as a transformative project for Southern Dallas.\nPlans call for thousands of residential units, 1.5 million square feet of commercial space and more than 50 acres of green space. The project could create a commercial hub in an area where median income levels are about 60 percent of the Dallas-Fort Worth average.\n\nHoque faced scrutiny from delays on other projects, and Dallas officials said the city would terminate the agreement if the firm missed any deadlines.\nIt missed a deadline last year for vertical construction at its\n$50 million mixed-use project\nin Mansfield, and it was\nremoved as the master developer\nfor the Evans and Rosedale Urban Village in Fort Worth last April, after the city cited “unacceptable delays.”\nHoque contested those claims but did not reapply for the project.\nThe firm last year sold 580 lots in University Hills to D.R. Horton and Lennar for townhome and single-family development. It is also a partner in the proposed\n$350 million redevelopment\nof downtown Dallas’ Bank of America Plaza with Mike Ablon of PegasusAblon.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "The state legislature is doubling down on the governor’s proposal to deter institutional investors from buying single-family homes in New York.\nSenate and Assembly Democrats on Tuesday released their responses to Gov. Kathy Hochul’s\nexecutive budget\n, both proposing more restrictions on these investors and higher tax rates for the state’s top earners.\nThe governor wants to bar institutional investors from bidding on single- and two-family homes for the first 75 days that these homes are on the market. The majorities of both chambers included this proposal in their budget resolutions, but also escalated efforts to kick these buyers out of the market — despite the\nlack of data\non the percentage of single-family homes owned by institutional investors in New York.\nThe Senate proposal includes\na bill\nsponsored by Sen. Liz Krueger and Assembly member Michaelle Solages, dubbed the End Hedge Fund Control of New York Homes Act. The measure would impose a tax worth 50 percent of the value of a single-family home (defined in the bill as having up to four units) on hedge funds, private equity firms and others when they purchase these properties.\nThe Assembly’s resolution seeks to discourage entities from scooping up single- and two-family homes. The Assembly has significantly broadened the definition of an institutional investor — characterizing it as someone with a net value of or assets worth $5 million or more, as opposed to the $50 million threshold pitched by the governor.\nThe proposal goes even further, establishing a fee equal to 10 percent of the purchase price and granting homeowners automatic protection from investors’ solicitations.\nState officials have not, however, been able to provide information demonstrating how\nprevalent\nthese purchases are in New York.\nDuring a budget hearing last month, RuthAnne Visnauskas, head of the Division of Homes and Community Renewal, said that mayors in Albany, Rochester and other cities have reported that hundreds of homes have been scooped up by such buyers. Visnauskas could not provide data.\nReports have repeatedly pegged the share of single-family homes owned by institutional investors at between 2 and 3 percent, though the percentages are higher in parts of the Sun Belt. A\nDecember report\nby CoreLogic showed mom-and-pop investors made up the lion’s share of so-called investor deals in New York City between January and June, as was the case in the 19 other top metro areas.\nBoth the Assembly and Senate excluded the governor’s proposal to curb the use of price-fixing software used to set rents.\nThese resolutions are not binding, but provide a snapshot of each chamber’s priorities heading into budget negotiations. As with the\ngovernor’s executive budget\n, these resolutions do not take any\nbig swings\nat ramping up housing construction. The Senate proposal indicates that the chamber is “open” to further discussing the Faith-Based Affordable Housing Act, which would make it easier for religious organizations to build affordable housing on their property.\nHousing ground rules\nIn December, Hochul pledged to commit $1 billion to help build housing in New York City. The funds helped secure approval of the\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n, which included several zoning changes aimed at making it easier to build an estimated 80,000 new housing units. The governor did not, however, specify how those funds would be\ndivided\n.\n\nThe Senate resolution specifies that a little more than half of that money, spread out over five years, should go to the New York City Housing Authority. The remaining $500 million would be divvied up between various efforts, including $150 million for the construction of new rental housing, $80 million for a mixed-income housing revolving loan fund and $50 million to preserve Mitchell-Lama housing.\nThe Assembly’s bill doesn’t address how the City of Yes funds should be distributed but calls for increased investments in supportive housing, community land trusts and other housing models.\nThe Democratic majorities of both chambers\nonce again\nincluded $250 million to fund a state-run housing voucher program. The proposal has garnered support from both tenant and real estate groups in recent years, but Hochul has repeatedly refused to back it.\nThe resolutions do not include much for owners of rent-stabilized apartments, who have urged lawmakers to provide more relief from the 2019 rent law, which severely limited rent increases on these apartments. The\nstate budget\nlast year slightly raised the amount that landlords who renovate apartments can increase rents, but owners argue this will barely make a dent in the level of distress seen across stabilized properties.\nThe Assembly resolution, however, includes a $275 million tax credit for renters with incomes lower than $200,000. The benefit would be capped at $750.\nHigher taxes for millionaires, tax credits for tenants\nThe governor’s proposed budget called for extending the state’s millionaire’s tax for another five years. The rates, the highest of which is 10.9 percent and applies to those earning more than $25 million, are slated to expire in 2027. The Assembly and Senate proposed extending the tax and increasing the rates, with the Senate pushing an increase of .5 percent on the two top tier earners, and the Assembly advocating for increases across the board, with the highest rate becoming 12 percent.\nHochul also floated extending the state’s film production tax credit for two years, as well as pushing the deadline for a tax credit provided to certain businesses that move to locations above 96th Street in Manhattan or the other boroughs. Both the Assembly and the Senate resolutions exclude extensions to the latter, known as the Relocation and Employment Assistance Program.\nThe two budget resolutions also call for an expansion of the types of projects where developers must pay construction workers prevailing wages. Such wage requirements kick in when project costs exceed $5 million and if at least 30 percent of the project is funded through public money. The Assembly and Senate are pushing to reduce that threshold to 20 percent, and to eliminate a board that was given the authority to determine which projects must pay these higher wages. The head of the Real Estate Board of New York and the Building and Construction Trades Council are members of the board.\nIn an\nop-ed for amNY\n, Gary LaBarbera, president of the New York City and state chapters of the BCTC, said the board  is “at its best ineffective and at its worst, a roadblock.” He noted that the board has only approved six projects since it was created in 2022.\nTwo bills strongly opposed by the real estate industry were not included in the resolutions, including a measure that would cap increases on ground-lease rent at co-ops, nor\nanother\nthat would make it easier for localities outside New York City to adopt rent stabilization.\nThe budget is due April 1.\n",

    "content": "There could soon be a new high-water mark for industrial sales on Long Island.\nPlainview-based Rechler Equity Partners is shopping the Hampton Business District in Westhampton Beach, according to Green Street. Bidding for the five-building, 385,000-square-foot industrial park on the East End is expected to top $200 million.\nThe five-acre campus at 200, 215, 220, 230 and 245 Roger’s Way was completed five years ago. The property is 94 percent leased by two dozen tenants, who have a weighted average remaining term of more than seven years. Among the major tenants are Amazon and Iron Mountain; Amazon is responsible for 27 percent of the property’s income.\nThere’s room for growth on the rent front, though. The rents in place are 17.5 percent below market rate, on average.\nThe property benefits from proximity to the local airport and Sunrise Highway, connecting the campus with much of Long Island. The rare industrial park in the Hamptons also provides access to e-commerce demand in the area, which saw such sales rise by 30 percent each year since 2020 — double the national rate.\nJLL has the listing for the property. Should a sale price come close to the projections, it would shatter Long Island’s industrial record, Starwood Capital’s $146 million acquisition of an asset in Inwood two years ago.\n\nThere have been a number of big industrial deals on the island in recent months.\nIn September, Bahrain-based Investcorp purchased a five-property, 435,000-square-foot industrial portfolio in Suffolk County from a joint venture between Metropolitan Realty Associates and TPG Angelo Gordon\nfor $95.8 million\n.\nTwo months later, NorthBridge Partners\npaid $105.7 million\nto purchase two Bay Shore properties from the Rockefeller Group.\nIn the fourth quarter, leasing activity in Long Island’s industrial market fell to 389,000 square feet, the lowest total in two years, according to\nCBRE\n. Occupancy shrank by 246,000 square feet while the vacancy rate rose to 7 percent.\n",

    "content": "Seaport Entertainment Group is looking to sell the controversial site in the Financial District that Howard Hughes Holding Company spent years trying to develop.\nSEG is marketing 250 Water Street to interested parties, Crain’s\nreported\n. There’s no asking price associated with the listing, but the land’s gross carrying value is $143 million, according to an annual report from the owner.\n“The best value for the company is going to be realized either through an outright sale to a developer and an operator who specializes in multi-family and mixed-use developments, or to partner with someone with this expertise,” SEG chief executive officer Anton Nikodemus said on a conference call on Tuesday.\nJLL is fielding bids for the site.\nIt’s a stunning aboutface after all of the\nlegal wrangling\nover the site, which Howard Hughes spent years trying to develop; SEG was spun out from Howard Hughes in August.\n\nHoward Hughes purchased the site for $180 million in 2018 after the seller, the Mistein family, repeatedly tried and failed to secure approval to build on the site. Howard Hughes received final approval to do so at the end of 2021.\nBut in July 2022, the South Street Seaport Coalition\nfiled a lawsuit\nchallenging the Landmark Preservation Commission’s approval of the project. In 2023, a judge voided the approval, citing an “impermissible quid pro quo” between the developer and the LPC. A panel of appellate judges later\nreversed\nthat decision.\nThe site’s development approval is for 26 stories and 399 units. Howard Hughes broke ground in 2022 and placed foundation footings by June 15, 2022, so the site qualifies for the 421a tax abatement after the completion deadline for the program was extended to June 2031.\nSEG also signed interactive art exhibitor Meow Wolf to a 20-year,\n75,000-square-foot lease\nat Pier 17. Construction for the buildout is scheduled to begin in the third quarter.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

    "content": "The Florida Legislature is considering bills this session that target two of the thorniest issues at condo and homeowners associations: alleged fraud and structural requirements.\nFor decades, some communities have been hotbeds for board members’\nalleged mismanagement and fraud\n. In the biggest fraud case in recent years, authorities in 2022 charged four former board members of the\nHammocks HOA\nand the husband of one of the ex-board members with misappropriating association funds to the tune of $2 million. The Hammocks, home to more than 18,000 residents in West Kendall, is South Florida’s biggest HOA.\nTo combat fraud, this legislative session’s bills seek to introduce an investigations pilot program and expand the powers of state oversight agencies.\nOther bills deal with hefty structural safety requirements imposed on condo associations following the deadly\nChamplain Towers South\ncollapse in Surfside in 2021. Since then, state lawmakers beefed up mandates in hopes of ensuring buildings’ safety. By the end of last year, all Florida condo associations were supposed to complete structural integrity reserve studies (SIRS). Starting this year, they are required to fully fund reserves. Condo associations also face milestone inspections once buildings reach 30 years, and every 10 years afterward.\nBut these requirements have proven to be a financial burden on unit owners. Many are getting hit with\nmultimillion-dollar special assessments\nto pay for repairs.\nBills proposed this session aim to give condo associations a reprieve from structural requirements, including giving options to finance repairs.\nThe legislative session started on March 4 and ends on May 2.\nSB 120/HB 137\nState lawmakers want to appoint an HOAs ombudsman, after they\nfailed to approve a similar proposal at last year’s session\n.\nCurrently, the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) has less oversight over HOAs than condo associations. While DBPR’s administrative staff includes a condo ombudsman, the department does not have one for HOAs.\nUnder the proposed bills, the HOAs ombudsman will serve as a liaison among homeowners, boards of directors, association managers, DBPR and others, as well as develop policies and procedures so residents and boards understand their rights and responsibilities. The ombudsman will be able to mediate between homeowners and association leaders, as well as monitor and review complaints and recommend investigations by DBPR if election tampering is suspected.\nThe ombudsman also can appoint a board elections monitor if 15 percent of homeowners or six homeowners, whichever is greater, vote for this. The association would pay for the monitor.\nThe governor would appoint the ombudsman, who will have to be an attorney. The position will be within DBPR’s Division of Florida Condominiums, Timeshares, and Mobile Homes.\nSen. Danny Burgess, a Republican whose district includes parts of Hillsborough and Pasco counties, and Rep. Jervonte “Tae” Edmonds, a Democrat representing a portion of Palm Beach County, introduced the bills.\nSB 368\nThis bill again brings up an initiative Florida lawmakers failed to approve last year: a fraud investigation pilot program.\nThis year’s version is broader than that of last year, which only sought to create the program for condo associations. Under the latest bill, the state would initiate the Economic Crime, Fraud and Corruption Investigation Pilot Program for both condo and homeowners associations within the Florida Legal Affairs Department.\nThe bill aims to give HOAs a state ombudsman by expanding the existing condo association ombudsman’s powers to HOAs. The proposal will allow the ombudsman to void an election if voting issues are determined, request a court-appointed receiver for an association, issue subpoenas and conduct association audits.\nUnder the bill, the ombudsman would review complaints and decide which should be sent to the Economic Crime, Fraud and Corruption Investigation Pilot Program. If the staff of the pilot program determines the alleged wrongdoing is not within their purview, they would forward the complaint to DBPR’s condo, timeshares and mobile homes division.\nTo aid the pilot program’s investigation, the state will subpoena and audit association records. If sufficient evidence of corruption is found, complaints will be forwarded to state attorney’s offices.\nThe pilot program, which would sunset on Oct. 2, 2030, unless the legislature renews it, would be based in Miami-Dade County. It would be funded from DBPR’s Division of Florida Condominiums, Timeshares, and Mobile Homes Trust Fund.\nThe bill’s other provisions include a requirement on condo associations to establish a searchable, cloud-based database with information about each association in Florida, including the names and contact information of board members; governing documents such as declarations and by-laws; annual budgets, including regular and special assessments, as well as their purpose; and copies of SIRS and other reports on a property’s physical condition.\nThe bill gives DBPR the right to levy fines on condo associations that fail to maintain insurance or a fidelity bond.\nFinally, the bill spells out procedures for HOAs to levy fines on homeowners, including that these fees can’t be more than $1,000, and levy suspensions on homeowners if they violate association declarations or by-laws. If a homeowner fixes a violation before his/her hearing, the association can’t levy the fine or suspension. If a homeowner cures an issue within 30 days after a hearing, the fine is halved and the suspension lifted. Also, fines won’t be due earlier than 30 days after a hearing. If a homeowner fails to pay a fine, the association also will be owed attorney fees.\n\nThe bill was introduced by Sen. Ileana Garcia, a Republican who represents part of Miami-Dade.\nHB 983/SB 1600\nBoth bills say that a homeowner’s voting rights cannot be suspended when voting in a board recall. This includes lifting all previous suspensions to allow the homeowner to cast a recall ballot.\nThe proposals come as residents at some South Florida condo associations and HOAs have filed recall petitions, seeking to replace board members over various allegations, including mismanagement. In some cases, boards reviewing recall petitions deemed some homeowners’ votes invalid due to suspensions\nover reasons such as overdue assessments\n.\nUnder the bills, boards have to hold a meeting within five business days after receiving a recall petition to decide its validity.\nThe bills’ other proposals include that at least 20 percent of homeowners have to cast ballots in board elections for the elections to be valid.\nHB 983 also creates amenity dues at HOAs, which are different from assessments. Homeowners would pay the amenity dues to private owners of recreational facilities at HOAs to use these facilities.\nHB 983 was co-introduced by Rep. Juan Carlos Porras, a Republican representing a portion of Miami-Dade County, and Rep. Meg Weinberger, a Republican representing a portion of Palm Beach County. Sen. Kristen Aston Arrington, a Democrat representing Osceola County and a portion of Orange County, introduced SB 1600.\nHB 913\nIn an attempt to enforce compliance with SIRS, a lawmaker proposes withholding coverage by\nCitizens Property Insurance\n, the state carrier of last resort, from condo associations that fail to meet structural integrity requirements.\nThe proposal comes as associations already have been struggling to obtain insurance due to several underwriters exiting the state and increased\npremiums and deductibles\nfrom the insurers still in Florida.\nThe bill also could be beneficial to developers who purchase a bulk of units at aging condo buildings and seek to dissolve the condo association. Specifically, the proposal eases the undoing of the association governing structure at buildings where repair costs exceed the property’s value.\nRep. Vicki Lopez, a Republican whose district includes Key Biscayne and parts of Miami, introduced the bill.\nSB 1742\nUnder this bill, condo associations can invest reserve funds in depository accounts for community, savings and commercial banks, or in credit unions.\nCondo boards are to create investment committees consisting of two board members and two unit owners who aren’t board members. The committee will recommend an investment adviser to be hired to manage reserve fund investment portfolios. Any interest earned on the portfolios that isn’t allocated for specific association uses has to be spent on capital improvements or maintenance.\nThe bill also aims to give a reprieve to condo associations facing higher expenses to meet structural integrity requirements. For budgets adopted prior to or on Dec. 31, 2028, unit owners can vote for their association to obtain a line of credit to help cover reserve funds required under SIRS.\nSB 1742 also proposes that associations with budgets approved prior to or on Dec. 31, 2028, that completed their milestone inspections in the previous two years, can temporarily pause reserve funding in order to finance repairs determined as necessary under the inspections. Associations that completed milestone inspections can delay their SIRS for up to two years to allow them to direct their funds to cover repairs.\nThe bill also aims to curb conflicts of interest between companies that conduct SIRS and contractors that do the repairs outlined as necessary under SIRS. It mandates that SIRS recommend reserve funding schedules in addition to determining necessary repairs.\nSen. Jennifer Bradley, a Republican representing the northern part of the state, introduced the bill. Her district includes part of Alachua County, as well as Baker, Bradford, Clay, Columbia, Gilchrist and Union counties.\nSB 690/HB 1415\nThe bills mark another attempt by state lawmakers to give condo associations a reprieve from the stricter structural integrity requirements imposed after the Surfside collapse.\nUnder the proposals, the SIRS requirement will be scaled back to condo buildings that are six stories or taller.\nAssociations for condo buildings that are five stories or shorter can elect, through a vote of unit owners, to waive funding reserves or to reduce reserve funding.\nSen. Rosalind Osgood, a Democrat representing part of Broward County, introduced SB 690, and Rep. Bruce Hadley Antone, a Democrat representing part of Orange County introduced HB 1415.",

    "content": "Nineteen West 46th Street is not the thinnest building in Manhattan. It’s not even the second-thinnest. But at just 12 and one-quarter feet wide, it is perhaps the third-thinnest of the borough’s 47,000 buildings.\nA passerby might miss the building entirely if they happened to glance down at their phone for a moment. And that would be a shame.\n“It’s an interesting little building,” said Scott Weinberg, a real estate attorney who works nearby. “I deal with buildings all the time in my work. I like walking around the city and seeing things that you wouldn’t think should be there, given all the development that’s going on.”\n“Little” is an understatement. It’s so narrow that on a basketball court, it would fit between the free-throw line and the front of the rim, with a foot to spare.\nLike all unusual buildings in New York City, 19 West 46th Street has a story behind it. Built in 1865, the brownstone is a lone relic from an era when the block between Fifth and Sixth avenues was entirely residential.\n“Mine’s the last man standing,” said Sean Sedaghatpour, whose\nGreat Neck-based\nElisheva Realty bought the building in 2021 for $2.65 million.\nSedaghatpour said he does not specialize in skinny buildings. But as it happens, he also owns a 10-foot-wide building at 210 East 52nd Street, possibly the borough’s second-thinnest, according to property records. (The narrowest building, at 75 ½ Bedford Street, is nine and one-half feet wide).\n\nNineteen West 46th Street was built by a developer who bought one of the last remaining lots on the block and divided it in half, according to the blog\nDaytonian in Manhattan\n. He built two matching townhouses at 17 and 19, hoping to maximize profits.\nBut one twin was demolished in the 1920s to make way for a 10-story office building. That property is\nnow owned by\nGary Barnett’s Extell Development, which is planning a\n32-story office tower\non the corner. It is unclear what Barnett’s plans are for the office building, which was set to be demolished by the previous owner. A spokesperson for Extell did not respond to a request for comment.\nOn the other side, Jack Elo’s eponymous firm bought the\n15-story office building\nat 21 West 46th Street, which he plans to keep as an office.\nThe tiny townhouse remains, although the stoop was removed in 1911 when the parlor and ground floors were renovated for commercial use. A variety of businesses have occupied the building, including a perfume store, antiques dealer, and a bartending school. It’s now a Spanish Tapas restaurant.\nThe upper floors are apartments, and Sedaghatpour said he has no immediate plans to sell the building. An unknown developer swooping in to buy the tiny parcel seems unlikely anyway.\n“It’s a very tiny building, so it doesn’t really have any potential except for me buying it or the owner on the other side buying it,” Elo said. “And I don’t think that’s going to happen.”\n",

It also includes two single-family residences at 9800 Wanda Park Drive and 2534 Hutton Drive.\nRecords through PropertyShark and listing sites note the property is in pre-foreclosure after a notice of default was sent in November, alleging a $49.7 million unpaid balance at that time.\nThe notice of default indicates Motcomb Estates Ltd. provided a $30 million loan to 9712 Oak Pass Road LLC, which Florida state records show is tied to developer Gary Safady.\nMotcomb handles property investments for real estate investment and development firm Reuben Brothers, which is helmed by billionaires David and Simon Reuben.\nThe Agency’s Adam Rosenfeld and Feroz Taj have the listing and declined, through a brokerage spokesperson, to comment on the property outside of confirming only one seller is involved. Also marketing the property is Compass’ Carl Gambino.\nDavid Reuben Jr., Reuben Brothers principal and co-founder of Blackship Advisors, declined to comment. The Reubens’ attorney, Eric Orenstein of Rosenberg &amp; Estis, did not respond for comment.\nLuxe Ambitions\nThe mega-property was a point of contention a few years ago when Safady planned for a Bulgari-branded hotel.\nAn initial study for the project, when it was known as The Retreat at Benedict Canyon, called for a 59-room hotel along with eight single-family residences. The latter were to each total anywhere from 12,000 to 48,000 square feet, according to city planning documents.\nThe project drew the ire of some locals who were against the expected impacts of the large-scale construction project.\n\n“I believe we’ve taken the time to address all those issues,” Safady, who could not be immediately reached for comment Tuesday, told\nVoyageLA\nin April 2023.\nA few months after that interview ran, then-\nCity Planning Director Vincent Bertoni\nwrote to Safady that the project’s impact to the area was far greater than originally expected, effectively ending the entitlement process for the resort.\nMike Gatto, an attorney for Safady, told the\nLos Angeles Times\nfollowing the city’s decision to axe the project it sent “a message to all looking to invest in Los Angeles that the city can’t be trusted to follow its own rules.”\nGatto, reached Tuesday afternoon, said he wasn’t aware of any backup development plans following the city’s 2023 decision, which is when his retainer agreement with Safady ended.\n“Usually when there is a presence of a NIMBY group in an area, they make it so that whatever somebody proposes is going to be tough. Those factors would have made it very hard to build anything there,” Gatto told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nPricey Properties\nOak Pass Road now ranks as the third-priciest property on the market within Los Angeles County, according to Zillow records.\nThe county’s most expensive property currently for sale is Westside Estate Agency’s listing at 1261 Angelo Drive in Beverly Hills, which has a $195 million price tag. WEA founders Kurt Rappaport and Stephen Shapiro are marketing the property.\nAngelo Drive, also known as the\nPritzker Estate\n, gets its name from Hyatt Hotel heir Anthony Pritzker who built the 50,000-square-foot mega mansion with his now ex-wife Jeanne Pritzker. It has 16 bedrooms and 27 bathrooms.\nThe next priciest property on the market is 607 Siena Way, which is priced at $177 million by The Beverly Hills Estates’ Branden Williams and Rayni Williams. The eight-bed, 25-bath Villa Siena estate spans 35,000 square feet and hit the market in February.\n",

    "content": "The owners of a Newport Beach apartment complex by the Back Bay want to expand it by 366 units — at $800,000 a pop.\nDallas-based Park Newport LP has filed plans to expand its Park Newport Apartments at 1 Park Newport,\nthe Orange County Business Journal reported.\nThe 1,306-unit complex on 52 acres would expand by 366 apartments at a cost of $800,000 each. The total outlay: $293 million.\nThe sprawling complex along the bluffs of Upper Newport Bay sits across Jamboree Road from the Fashion Island mall. The complex, built a half century ago by Gerson Bakar &amp; Associates, has 44 two- and three-story buildings, plus seven pools, a clubhouse and 10 sport courts.\nResidents of Park Newport have included actors Telly Savalas and Raquel Welch, and athletes Joe Torre, Bobby Riggs and Dennis Rodman.\nThe property is now owned by San Francisco-based Prado Group, according to the Business Journal. It’s not clear how Park Newport, or a Park Newport Land it said was involved in the expansion, are tied.\nPlans for the 6-acre expansion call for demolishing a leasing building, reflecting pool, tennis court and a 260-vehicle parking structure, as well as six apartments.\nThe landlord would then build 360 new apartments, including 285 market-rate units and 15 set aside for low-income tenants. The other 60 new apartments are “density bonus” residences, an indication of affordable housing units, according to the Business Journal.\n\nThe project would include 40 studio, 138 one-bedroom, 151 two-bedroom and 31 three-bedroom apartments, with an average size of 950 square feet. It would also include a 12,000-square-foot amenity space and 7,000 square feet of shops.\nThe expansion of the largest apartment complex near Fashion Island is the latest development among other multifamily projects in the works.\nLocally based Irvine Company recently proposed a combined 800 apartment units at Villas of Fashion Island at 1000 San Joaquin Plaza and Newport Center’s Block 100, a four-building multifamily project at 11 Newport Center Drive.\nThe firm also wants to convert part of an office campus at MacArthur Court near John Wayne Airport into\n700 homes\n.\nThe upscale coastal city has a state-mandated plan to build\n4,845 homes by 2029\n, of which 2,386 would be affordable for very low-income and low-income households.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

They claim a fire exit on a centrally located stair, as practiced in Europe, is a far more manageable and “economically defensible” design.\n\nWhile common practice in European cities,\nSeattle has led the charge on single-stair reform\nin the U.S. Decades ago, the city tweaked its building code to allow for single-stair buildings up to six stories.\nWhile New York followed suit, Raman pointed out that\nSan Francisco\nand San Diego are also exploring single-stair rules after the passage of\nAssembly Bill 835\n, which directs the state fire marshal to develop standards for single-stair buildings by 2028.\nRaman’s motion seeks numerous reports on a single-stair regulation from the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety, Fire Department and the Planning Department, as well as the Livable Cities Initiatives and the American Institute of Architects.\nLikewise, the motion asks the Planning Department to report back on existing regulations in cities where single-stair buildings are allowed.\n“While the requirement for two stairwells was originally adopted for fire safety, developments over the past two to three decades have made such requirements obsolete,” explains\na landing page on the California YIMBY website\n. “Modern buildings across the U.S. and Europe have fire safety ratings that greatly exceed buildings with two staircases — even though they only have one staircase.”\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

The five-story building was sold for $43.25 million in 2014, setting a record at $319 per square foot.\nThe owner is a subsidiary of New York REIT Global Net Lease.\nThe building, at 127 International Drive in Franklin’s Cool Springs area, was built-to-suit for the IRS in 2012 by New York-based Acquest Development. Valued at $4.6 million annually, the lease is expected to save the United States government less than $32 million, according to DOGE’s\nwebsite\n.\nThe lease termination is notable for its size and its implications in markets like Franklin, where large government tenants can drive valuations. Trump is\nat war with the IRS\n, which has been the sole tenant in the building.\n\nDOGE, which was created by President Donald Trump through executive order but lacks Congressional approval as an official agency, has focused on slashing vacant or underutilized federal leases across the country. Its “wall of receipts” website claims it has terminated 748 federal leases totaling 9.5 million square feet, including five in Middle Tennessee, as of March 11.\nFor Franklin and Cool Springs, the IRS lease termination removes one of its largest federal footprints and could reshape the area’s office market as the building seeks a new purpose or tenant.\nNashville’s office vacancy rate was 18 percent in the fourth quarter, lower than the then national rate of 20.4 percent, according to Colliers. The city\nset the pace for office demand\nlast year, but Franklin’s vacancy rate was 24 percent in 2023, according to CommercialCafe.\n— Judah Duke\n",

Construction starts this spring, with completion anticipated by the end of 2027.\nThe project targets 73,200 square feet of destination and retail experiences designed to blend with Fredericksburg’s aesthetic appeal. The hotel brand hasn’t been revealed. Colliers’ Wade Green and Hannah Schiro are handling retail leasing.\nDallas-based Merriman Anderson Architects, the firm behind Dallas’ Statler Hotel revitalization, is leading design efforts, with Chicago-based Curioso handling the hotel interiors. Satterfield &amp; Pontikes, from Houston, is the construction manager.\nFredericksburg officials signaled their support for the project, saying it especially aligns with the city’s efforts to boost midweek tourism.\n\nThe Hill Country town has long been known for its small-town charm and robust tourism fueled by its wineries and German heritage. It was named one of the “most picturesque towns in America” by Reader’s Digest last year and received $1.4 million in American Rescue Plan funding in 2022 for infrastructure updates to accommodate swelling tourism.\nThe town was dubbed\n“the new Aspen”\nby Texas Monthly in 2021 for its high population of wealthy people and its part-time residents.\nCentral Texas is growing rapidly, and the Austin/San Antonio region is merging into a massive metro area.\nCrescent Real Estate is capitalizing on growing demand for upscale homes in the Texas Hill Country by developing a luxury residential project called Atten Hill in Horseshoe Bay, featuring 92 custom home sites on 114 acres, with prices starting around $500,000. The first phase will include 55 homes, and residents will enjoy exclusive amenities, including golf courses and a $40 million clubhouse.\n— Judah Duke\n",

It was snuffed out in an hour and 37 minutes.\nThe property appears to have been a two-story industrial building in front, backed by a 13,000-square-foot brick-and-timber warehouse, according to Loopnet and Google Maps.\nThe blaze was reported at 1:43 a.m. in the building between Venice and Pico boulevards, a couple of blocks east of the Los Angeles Convention Center and not far from Crypto.com Arena and L.A. Live, according to Margaret Stewart, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Fire Department.\nFirefighters arrived and found flames erupting from two parts of the building, she said. Video showed flames through the roof, which the fire department said had been the site of a fire in November.\n\nCrews found heavy fire in the one-story portion at the back and were able to knock the bulk of the fire down in about 15 minutes.\n“However, the situation escalated as flames rapidly spread into the adjacent one-story commercial building,” Stewart said. “Approximately 20 minutes into the incident, smoke and fire were visible in a separate, one-story commercial building two doors to the south.”\nThe scores of firefighters managed to douse the blaze by 3:20 a.m. No injuries were reported. It’s not clear whether the building had been occupied.\n“They fought the heavy fire for over an hour and successfully defended two exposed buildings — an auto body shop and four-story apartment building to the rear,” Stewart said. “Occupants of the apartment building were able to safely shelter in place, and no evacuation was required.”\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

The project would center around a five-story building featuring 7,500 square feet of retail — including a grocery store, cafe, community art center and pop-up retail — alongside 46 mixed-income residential units.\nThe project’s first phase would cost $39 million, funded by tax-increment financing, low-income housing tax credits, City of Chicago funds and a ComEd affordable housing grant. Subsequent phases would add more retail, residential units and outdoor community spaces.\nChicago Neighborhood Initiatives, with the Far South Chicago Community Development Corporation and designers Beehyyve and Gensler, proposed 1Fifteen at Michigan Station. It includes a four-story building with a 15,000-square-foot anchor grocery store, an 8,000-square-foot market hall for small businesses and 58 affordable apartments.\n\nAdditional phases envision retail, residential and community space, including townhomes and walk-up apartments surrounding a community park.\n1Fifteen’s initial phase is estimated to cost $48.3 million, supported by $15.8 million in tax credits, $26.7 million in government subsidies, $5.5 million in debt and $300,000 in philanthropic funds.\nBoth proposals emphasize sustainability and community connection and environmentally friendly elements, such as with solar panels, green roofs and rain gardens incorporated into their designs.\nThe city has opened the proposals to comment via an online survey. Residents can respond through March 21, but the city hasn’t said when the winner will be selected.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "Developers trying to make lemonade out of the Trump administration’s plan to offload North Texas’ federal buildings will need a lot of sugar.\nThe General Services Administration’s list of buildings around the country that are burning a hole in the government’s pocket included five office buildings (and one small parking garage) in Dallas-Fort Worth totalling 1.7 million square feet.\nNone of them provide a quick and easy path to redevelopment.\nThe offerings include the mammoth Fritz G. Lanham Federal Building in downtown Fort Worth as well as three buildings in downtown Dallas, ranging from from 190,000 square feet to 261,000 square feet. There’s also a 317,000-square-foot building in the Dallas suburb of Farmers Branch.\nThe most exciting conversion prospect is the historic Santa Fe Federal Building at 1114 Commerce Street in downtown Dallas. Dallas developer Tanya Ragan could see it becoming a mixed-use project with a hotel, office, retail and most important, a “fabulous rooftop.”\n“It would be one of the best views in the city, because you’re adjacent to so many historic sites,” she said. “There are strict height restrictions and no obstructions.”\nThe expense, however, would be enormous. A transformation would require “incredible incentives” that city leadership might not support, she said.\nThe Farmers Branch building that’s home to an IRS office might be the most straightforward property from a marketing perspective, said Marcus &amp; Millichap veteran Ron Hebert. It’s a land play.\nIf the building at\n4050 Alpha Road\nwas torn down, the 9.44-acre plot would be “a great size for multifamily,” he said. The suburb’s school district is more desirable to Dallas’, he added, and that community would be more likely to tolerate rezoning.\n\n“You’d look out and see the stadium and the Green Belt. You could go walk around the college. It’s not a bad location,” he said.\nWhile it sits on a much smaller plot — 2.87 acres — the A. Maceo Smith Federal Building could also be a land play, Ragan said. The 189,000-square-foot office building at 525 South Griffin Street was built in 1971 and last renovated almost 15 years ago.\nBut its proximity to the convention center is a bonus, she said.\nIt could also work for an owner-user like a charter school or nonprofit organization, Partners’ Steve Triolet said.\nThe Terminal Annex, another mid-size property on the list, could also have a second life as an updated office building, Triolet said. Ragan pointed out that parking is bad at the location, and it’s on the National Registry of Historic Places, so it can’t be easily torn down.\nWhile downtown Fort Worth’s Fritz G. Lanham Federal Building has the benefit of a desirable location, its massive size and layout might make it an albatross of a development project.\nIt could be suitable for a multi-tenant conversion or repurposed into a mixed-use office space, Triolet said.\nRegardless of the fate of these properties, Ragan worries they’ll mess with comps if the government opts for a fire sale.\n“That is going to come up for conversation for everything else that is out there on the market,” she said.\n",

    "content": "New allegations tied to a mortgage fraud scandal that rocked the industry and landed an executive in federal prison now implicate JPMorgan, the lender on the deal, and the borrower — New York’s Chetrit Group.\nWells Fargo, which filed suit in federal civil court as trustee on a $481 million CMBS loan, alleges JPMorgan knew the mortgage it made to\nChetrit\nfor a national multifamily portfolio was based on inflated financials. But it doled out the debt anyway.\nThe suit — first reported by Reuters — also alleges that the Chetrit Group was aware that the numbers had been fudged by the seller Roco Real Estate.\nRoco and the 43-property deal have been central to a widening federal investigation into\nmortgage fraud\n. In 2023, Roco principal\nTyler Ross\npleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to commit an offense against the United States related to a previous financing of the properties. He was sentenced to a year in federal prison in September.\nThe Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency have uncovered that in multiple deals, operators routinely manipulated property financials such as expenses to obtain larger loans from lenders than they would have otherwise secured.\nSo far, at least six real estate operators across the U.S. have pleaded guilty. The investigation is ongoing.\nWells Fargo’s filing marks the first major lawsuit against a lender in the broader commercial mortgage fraud scandal. Lenders have largely claimed to be victims of borrowers’ fraud.\nJPMorgan declined to comment on the lawsuit, as did an attorney for Wells Fargo.\nChetrit, through a spokesperson, pointed the finger at Roco, calling itself “a victim of seller fraud, which was investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice.”\n“Financial misrepresentations were made by the seller that we unknowingly relied upon when we purchased the property,” said a Chetrit representative in a statement.\n“We suffered great financial loss due to the seller’s fraud,” the spokesperson said. “As a result of the fraud, the seller was convicted.”\nThe saga dates back to 2019 when Chetrit was shopping for debt to buy Roco’s apartment deal. Through due diligence, it allegedly found Roco had falsified trailing 12 month financial statements, notably inflating net operating income by 25 percent.\n\nChetrit found $3.5 million in reported income did not exist and $2.6 million in repair costs and expenses were missing, according to the lawsuit. It allegedly flagged the errors to Roco and the seller fessed up to the flubs, agreeing to slash the sale price by over $65 million.\nThe Chetrits then brought the fraudulent financials to JPMorgan’s attention.\nInternally, the lender acknowledged the reporting was unreliable, according to the complaint. An analyst handling due diligence on the deal texted a colleague that the financial statements were “‘made up’” and “‘ridic[ulous],’” the suit details.\nUltimately, the 10,000-unit portfolio traded for $522 million, the suit states. The deal was risky — a $481 million loan on a $522 million acquisition shakes out to an incredible 92 percent loan-to-value ratio. But JPMorgan knew it would insulate itself from problems by immediately securitizing the deal, and pocket millions of dollars in fees to boot, according to the lawsuit.\nJPMorgan “was willing to issue such a risky loan because it never intended to hold it,” the suit said. Rather, the risk would be passed on to the deal’s unwitting bondholders, who now face tens of millions of dollars in losses, the suit alleges.\nWells Fargo argues JPMorgan “had an obligation” to validate whether the figures were accurate.\nChetrit defaulted on the debt in 2022 after the deals failed to generate sufficient cash flow to\nservice the loan\n. In early 2023, a spokesperson for the firm said it was looking to sell assets to right the ship.\nThe firm nabbed a temporary forbearance agreement in June 2023 but defaulted on the terms just a few months later, according to Morningstar Credit. A receiver was appointed in February 2024 and the past year has seen a spate of foreclosures: four Texas properties, three in Alabama, seven in Mississippi, according to Morningstar.\nPre-foreclosure filings in Florida, Ohio, Arkansas and Louisiana are pending, as of last month.\nMeanwhile, the Wells Fargo suit seeks to hold Meyer Chetrit, the guarantor on the debt, personally liable for the potential tens of millions in losses to the trust.\nThe trustee demands JPMorgan either repurchase the loan or pay damages to cover the trust’s losses.\n",

    "content": "Lafayette, a city of $2 million homes, has played a shell game with state housing regulators to avoid building its share of affordable housing.\nThat’s the contention of the Housing Action Coalition, a San Francisco-based housing advocate that is suing the East Bay city for creating “misleading and unrealistic housing sites” to satisfy state-mandated housing goals,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported\n.\nThe lawsuit seeks a court to compel the city to adopt a revised plan with an update to its zoning laws. The city must rezone to build 2,114 homes, 943 of them affordable, by 2031.\nThe coalition accuses the city of “pretending” to comply with the planning blueprint, known as the housing element, required of every city and county across the state every eight years.\nLafayette’s alleged shell game includes relying on faith-based institutions and longtime businesses with no plans to develop housing as potential building sites for homes, according to the complaint filed by Farella Braun and Martel a San Francisco-based law firm.\nIn one case, the city said a CVS will be torn down and rebuilt into 26 homes — but CVS has a long-term lease, with no intention of moving, according to the lawsuit. Other examples were not disclosed.\n“We hoped that Lafayette would take its responsibility to plan for housing seriously, but instead, they passed a housing element that deliberately ignores the facts,” Ali Sapirman, the advocacy and policy manager with the Housing Action Coalition, told the Chronicle. “Lafayette is continuing a pattern of obstruction, using questionable calculations to block much-needed housing while pretending to comply with state law.\n“The housing crisis is severe, and every city, including Lafayette, must do its fair share,” Sapirman added.\n\nIn its housing plan, Lafayette proposed using city-owned parking lots for housing, as well as sites downtown and at religious institutions to build affordable housing. The city projects that 27 accessory dwelling units will be built each year, for a total of 216 units.\nOfficials also said more than 150 units were under construction, with another 570 approved units in the development pipeline.\nThe city didn’t immediately return a request for comment by the newspaper.\nLafayette was once a battleground for the region’s housing wars, with two lawsuits, a ballot referendum and more than 100 public hearings that delayed a 315-unit apartment building for almost a dozen years.\nLast year, the\nstate Supreme Court declined\nto hear an appeal from a neighborhood group attempting to stop the development, allowing it to move forward. The project has not broken ground.\nWithin a 10-year span, 115 homes were built in the city of 25,000 residents, including 10 in 2010, 76 in 2018 and 29 in 2019 — according to its housing element plan.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Blueprint Capital alleges that King stopped making interest-only payments in August.\nKing did not respond to requests for comment.\n“I don’t care if you’re Don King or Mike Tyson, if you don’t pay your obligations, you’re going to get sued,” said David Haber, Blueprint Capital’s attorney. “In this case, they weren’t met and we had to file a foreclosure action.”\n\nFairway purchased the 4.4-acre industrial property for $3 million in 2000, records show. The building was completed in 1985. Two years ago, the entity obtained a $5.1 million loan from a previous lender that was increased by $200,000 in 2024 and personally guaranteed by King, the complaint states. Also last year, Blueprint Capital acquired the mortgage.\nA Boca Raton homeowner, the 93-year-old sports icon is among the 45th and 47th president’s most famous supporters. In a December Instagram post, King declared\nTrump\nwas “God sent; and people chosen, made the greatest political comeback in the history of America!!” Recently, King posted a selfie photo of himself wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat alongside\nElon Musk\n, the world’s richest man who is leading DOGE, or the Department of Government Efficiency.\nDOGE\nis charged with dumping federally-owned real estate as part of its nationwide purge of government assets, employees and programs.\nFound guilty of second-degree murder in 1967 and sentenced to 20 years in prison, King was released from prison three years later when his conviction was reduced to manslaughter. He rose to boxing prominence promoting and arranging some of the sport’s most famous fights featuring the late Muhammad Ali, considered the greatest boxing champion of all time. King also managed and promoted George Foreman, Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield and Roy Jones Jr., among other world champs.\nA longtime Palm Beach County resident, King owns a former\nJai Alai fronton\nin Mangonia Park that he tried to sell in the mid-2010s to a potential buyer that proposed redeveloping the site into a mixed-use project featuring a sports facility, retail stores, restaurants, a hotel and vocational and charter schools.

The seller is Hudson Pacific Properties, based in Los Angeles.\nThe real estate investment trust listed the 119-year-old brick and timber building last year, seeking between $200 and $250 per square foot, or between $27.7 million and $34.6 million.\nFinancial terms of the pending deal between Frontline and Hudson Pacific were not disclosed.

In January, the firm snapped up an 91,000-square foot building in a lender sale at 1440 Broadway in downtown Oakland for\n$5.5 million, or $60 per square foot\n, 86 percent less than its previous sale.\nFrontline founder Rob Mann described 1440 Broadway as the type of building he wanted to acquire more of: a well-located asset “with significant potential to create value through thoughtful repositioning and patience.”\nFrontline Realty Capital, founded in 2016, invests in industrial, retail and office properties in the Bay Area, Inland Empire and select western markets, according to its website.\nHudson Pacific Properties, founded in 2009 by Victor Coleman, owns 2.4 million square feet of property in San Francisco, after a buying spree in the early 2010s, according to a regulatory filing.

Green Brick owns five subsidiary homebuilders in Texas, including CB JENI Homes, Normandy Homes, Southgate Homes and a 90 percent interest in Centre Living Homes, according to its website.\n\nThe acquisition follows Green Brick’s September purchase of 557 acres along FM 1385 in northern Denton County, where it plans to build 2,200 homes near Pilot Point. The company cited the extension of the Dallas North Tollway to G.A. Moore Parkway as a factor in the area’s growing appeal to homebuyers.\nPrices are expected to start below $400,000. In February, the median home price in Denton County was about $480,000, in Cooke County it was $400,000 and in Grayson County it was $350,000, according to Realtor.com.\nFrom mid-2020 to mid-2023, the population in Denton County jumped 11.2 percent, increased 5.1 percent in Cooke County and 8.4 percent in Grayson County, census data shows.\nDenton County’s population surpassed 1 million in 2023, with nearly 30,000 new residents in a single year.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "A prominent real estate developer may be preparing to enter the race to be the next mayor of Boston.\nThomas O’Brien, managing partner of HYM Investment Group, is weighing a bid to supplant Michelle Wu at the top of the city’s political ranks, the Boston Globe\nreported\n. O’Brien has not officially announced a campaign for the election, which will take place in November.\nO’Brien would likely run as a Democrat. The top two vote-getters for mayor in preliminary voting in September would battle in a runoff two months later.\n“It is clear some developers are willing to do whatever it takes to buy this office,” read a statement from the Wu reelection campaign.“It seems like Josh Kraft is not turning out to be what they expected and now they are shopping for a new option.”\nResidents and business leaders have called O’Brien to express concern about fiscal health, rising property taxes, affordable housing and the quality of the city’s public school system. The commercial real estate community has lately grown frustrated with Wu, particularly her attempts to\nraise commercial property tax rates\nwhile capping rent hikes for residences.\nO’Brien has a number of important real estate developments in the works with HYM. The firm is spearheading the redevelopment of Suffolk Downs and the Government Center Garage. The firm also won the bid to develop a parcel in Roxbury into a life sciences hub and housing.\n\nProminent projects for HYM, which launched in 2009, also include Boston Landing in Brighton, NorthPoint in Cambridge and Bulfinch Crossing in downtown Boston.\nO’Brien — brother of Boston College football coach Bill O’Brien — served the city for five years at the city planning and development agency under Thomas Menino in the 1990s. He resigned after a scandal erupted over a senior agency aide buying a subsidized condo intended for low-income families.\nAnother candidate with a football connection, Josh Kraft — son of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft —\nlaunched his campaign\nlast month. The philanthropist is honing in on rent control and more affordable housing while distancing from his father’s ties to Donald Trump.\nWu will be difficult to beat in the fall, as no incumbent mayor in the city has lost a re-election campaign in more than 75 years.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Even “desolate.”\nThen came a\nflood\nof new restaurants, coffee shops and stores, filling the streets with people.\nWith increased popularity, landlords also have boosted rents.\nSouthern Land’s project site\nused to be mostly vacant land, with a shuttered commercial building that had broken windows, graffiti and homeless sleepers.\nThe company is now building three seven-story buildings there with a two-story fitness center, a rooftop deck and 8,600 square feet of ground-floor shops and restaurants. The firm expects to open early next year, according to Southern Land development manager Alex Woodin.\n\nWoodin said his firm began looking at the Arts District four years ago, noting its walkability.\n“It felt good, it felt right,” he told the Review-Journal.\nCedar Street Companies and Bridge Investment Group have also broken ground, and have said they expect to open by next summer. The seven-story complex will include a large fitness center, a resort-style spa, including saunas, and ground-floor shops and restaurants.\nSouthern Land, founded in 1986 by Tim Downey, has built apartments and homes from New York to Nevada, according to its website.\nCedar Street Companies, founded in 2009 by Alex Samoylovich, Will Murphy and Mark Heffron, has $4 billion in assets under management, including 7,500 apartments across numerous markets, including Chicago, San Diego, Portland, Minneapolis and Cleveland, according to a release.\nBridge Investment Group, an alternative investment firm founded in 2009, had $49.4 billion of assets under management as of September 2023. The firm went public in 2021.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Jackson-Shaw Chairman Lewis W. Shaw, who built a small Dallas firm into a real estate development titan, has died. He was 82.\nShaw was raised in Dayton, Ohio, and graduated from Wittenberg University in Springfield before serving in the United States Air Force, where he was a cryptologist and flight instructor. He arrived in Dallas to work for IBM in 1974.\n“I’d always wanted to be a Texan,” he told the Dallas Morning News in 2004. His father was an orphan, raised in the Buckner Children’s Home in Dallas, and was killed at a railroad crossing when Shaw was 4. As a child, Shaw spent summers with an uncle in Aransas Pass.\nShaw met Jim Jackson at Addison Airport when Jackson asked Shaw to give him aerobatic lessons, and Jackson hired Shaw as a salesman at his four-person real estate firm Jackson Companies. Shaw took over the company after Jackson died in a plane crash in 1976 and renamed it two years later.\nUnder Shaw’s leadership, Jackson-Shaw developed more than 63 million square feet of industrial and hospitality real estate nationwide, including hotels in Las Vegas, Phoenix and Fort Worth, as well as nondescript low-rise office and industrial buildings tucked into major cities.\nHe was known for financing his own projects and hanging onto assets the firm developed rather than selling them off.\n“I don’t build with somebody else’s MasterCard,” Shaw told the Dallas Morning News in 2004. “My first priority is who will pay the rent, not who will buy the project. It’s cash flow, not cashing out.”\nPart of his development strategy for light industrial development was to find land that nobody wanted.\n\n“I don’t want to join the crowd. I want to get there before it assembles. Proof of low demand for me is proof of opportunity,” he said in 2004.\nShaw co-founded American General Hospitality in 1980. Its portfolio fell into distress after the global stock markets crash of 1987, and lenders took nine of its properties, but Shaw continued to manage them.\nThe hospitality company became a publicly traded REIT in 1996 and later merged with Meristar REIT and Interstate Hotels &amp; Resorts.\nShaw was known as a reader and a music lover who had a casual style of dressing and a contrarian spirit.\n“Lewis is a lone wolf avoiding the herd mentality yet fiercely loyal to his friends and partners,” NAI Global Chairman Tom Lynn said in 2004.\nA list of survivors wasn’t immediately available.\nShaw was inducted into the North Texas Commercial Association of Realtors Hall of Fame in 2003. He also served on the Wittenberg University Board of Directors and was actively involved in numerous civic and national organizations. A dedicated aviator, he had a lifelong passion for flying and traveled extensively in his own aircraft.\n",

    "content": "Multifamily landlords have the upper hand over Chicago renters, and that’s not likely to change for years as apartment leasing prices are set to soar amid a cliffdrop for development.\nThe city’s downtown apartment market reached new heights last year, when the average unit within a group of 84 buildings tracked by Luxury Living surpassed $3,000 for the first time ever, according to the multifamily brokerage and consultant. The mean figure landed at $3,077, up 28 percent from 2023, with units in the Streeterville neighborhood — which holds the largest average floorplans of downtown areas — commanding the most-expensive average rent at $3,648.\nLandlords and their leasing teams pushed prices to the new milestone despite smaller units — studios and convertibles, in particular — making up a larger share of deals last year, Luxury Living found.\n“Knowing how minimal the new supply pipeline is, it’s easy to see demand will continue to go up. Retention will be high,” said Aaron Galvin, Luxury Living’s founder and a developer of the Saint Grand, a 248-unit tower in Streeterville that was being leased last year after opening to residents.\nLease signings increased 33 percent last year within the buildings studied, up to 14,086 from 10,600 in 2023. But there’s little carryover of new, move-in ready units into this year. In fact, only about 500 units are expected to come online this year, down from the 10-year average of more than 3,500 units, according to Integra Realty Resources. Historically low vacancy rates are the anticipated result.\n“Rents are expected to spike in 2025,” Integra said in its outlook.\nThe next two years aren’t so promising for renters, either, as developers are constrained by tight capital markets, rising construction costs and, most recently, increased uncertainty over material costs as President Trump threatens major trading partners with tariffs.\n\n“Developers indicate virtually every deal remains in a holding pattern until at least mid-2025,” Integra said, noting that the next wave of deliveries won’t occur until 2027 at the earliest.\nBehind Streeterville, the next-priciest downtown Chicago submarkets are River North, Gold Coast/Old Town and the West Loop/Fulton Market, which are the only others with average unit rents in excess of $3,000. The Loop was the only neighborhood where renters might have caught a break last year, with the average lease signed decreasing slightly to $2,848, down from $2,872 in 2023, Luxury Living found. The South Loop and River West respectively trailed those neighborhoods.\nFurthermore, the average unit size stayed fairly flat last year, at 781 square feet, up from 777 in 2023, but tenants opted far more often for studio and convertible units, forsaking the extra space offered by one-bedroom layouts in exchange for a break on cost, Galvin said. Rents per square foot were up 2.1 percent to $3.94 last year.\n“That’s coming down to attainability in terms of income that we’re seeing in the market,” Galvin said. ​​”There are just that many more people making enough money to qualify for studios and convertibles, as compared to one-beds.”\nRenters of smaller units are also less likely to need parking, he said, which developers are noting as they plot their return to the market from the slowdown.\n“When you’re looking at construction costs and how to get the development pipeline turned on again, less parking is likely to be more of a trend moving forward,” Galvin said.\nEditor’s note: This story was updated to correct the rents per square foot figure.\n",

    "content": "Homebuilders are prepping for an industry doomsday: President Donald Trump’s tariffs.\nBuilders and contractors across the country told the Wall Street Journal they were accumulating materials or altering construction plans as the administration’s plan to tax imports takes shape, spelling concerns for heightened home prices\nSome contractors are paying out of pocket to acquire lumber, steel and other materials before Trump’s tariffs are implemented. In addition to the money needed upfront to acquire the surplus of goods, builders also need to pay for places to store the excess materials.\nWhile Trump aired tariffs ahead of his election victory in November, his broadside promises have grown more uncertain in recent weeks.\n“I can’t keep ping ponging back and forth,” Idaho-based Steve Martinez told the Journal after Trump’s latest pause on select tariffs implemented against Canada and Mexico.\nLumber is among the items affected; more than 70 percent of imported softwood lumber comes from the two countries, according to the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nTariffs aren’t the only challenge facing builders under Trump. Contractors are also facing the potential loss of immigrant labor due to the administration’s hardline stance on illegal immigration and steady stream of deportation threats.\nIf or when the tariffs do land, the extra costs will likely result in ballooning home prices. The NAHB estimates the costs of building a single-family home could increase by $7,500 to $10,000.\nBuilders anticipated the tough times ahead under Trump’s second term, with reports of stockpiling materials surfacing\nshortly after the election\n. But a drop in consumer demand for new homes could leave builders paying to store materials they can’t use.\nOther builders are exploring materials that can be sourced in the United States, constructing smaller homes or taking a stab at modular construction. Builders are also pursuing incentives to reel in buyers, such as mortgage buydowns and cash discounts.\n—\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

It has two bedrooms and a study and comes with two parking spaces, a storage unit and electric car charger. Betty Epperson of Epperson Realty Group had the listing.\nUnit H at 706 West Avenue in downtown was recently renovated and has three bedrooms. It spans 2,200 square feet, asking $1,000 per square foot, with a private two-car garage. Moreland Properties agent Monica Painter had the listing.\nThe highest-priced active condo listing came online on March 10, asking $4.25 million, unit at The Colorfield at 1006 Baylor Street. Unit 303 is one of 10 residences in the building, spanning almost 3,000 square feet with three bedrooms. Unit 202 also hit the market the same day asking for $3.75 million. Moreland Properties is selling all units at the development.\nAustin developer Cumby Group will open its four-story The Colorfield development this summer, according to its website. Its penthouse unit is listed for $9 million.\n\nThe majority of the single-family homes under contract were centered around Tarrytown and West Lake Hills, with a few exceptions.\nLast listed at $3.8 million, the top contract was signed for a home at 16001 Pontevedra Place in the Barton Creek Bluffs neighborhood in Bee Cave. It spans 6,000 square feet on 1 acre, asking about $630 per square foot, with two stories and six bedrooms plus a media room, two game rooms, a pool and sports court. Thomas Stone from Stone Properties has the listing.\nAlso outside the usual high-end neighborhoods where multi-million dollar homes sell, the lowest-priced deal of the bunch was for a $2.4 million new home near Bear Creek, listed by Clay Lake of Keeping It Realty. It spans 4,260 square feet on over 2 acres, asking about $565 per square foot.\nThe second priciest deal was for a home asking $3.3 million in Tarrytown. At 3600 Taylors Drive, the four bedroom, 3,000-square-foot home comes with an office and a pool on a third of an acre. It asked for about $1,085 per square foot and was listed by Megan DeLeeuw Cavazos of Gottesman Residential Real Estate.\nMore contracts were signed last week than\nthe week before\n, from 10 to 12, but total sales volume dropped $2.3 million to $34.1 million.\nThe single-family homes had an average of $721 per square foot and their average days on market increased slightly to 68 from 63 days, the report said. The two condos had an average of $1,144 per square foot and 185 days on market.\n",

    "content": "A suburban residential development’s future may hinge on negotiations as much as planning.\nThe Wirtz family, owners of the Chicago Blackhawks and Breakthru Beverage Group, has reopened talks with local school districts over impact fees tied to its massive Ivanhoe Village development, Crain’s\nreported\n.\nThe renewed talks follow\nescalating tensions\nbetween the Wirtz Realty Corporation, Mundelein officials and two school districts over how much the developer should pay to offset the project’s impact on public services.\nThe districts say the development could bring as many as 1,000 new students to the schools over 25 years and cost an estimated $150 million for new facilities.\nRepresentatives for the Wirtzes halted the talks in January.\nThe Mundelein Village Board pulled two agenda items from its meeting this week — one on the proposed fee terms and the second an ordinance on codifying a formula for calculating the fees — to allow for further negotiations.\n\nThe village board’s review of Wirtz’s proposed impact fee contributions, originally scheduled for March 11, was also postponed.\nIvanhoe Village, a 3,600-home development planned over 740 acres, is expected to take 20 to 25 years. The impact fees are meant to help districts fund expansions and improvements to accommodate the growth.\nNegotiations stalled over a massive gap in expectations. Fremont School District 79 is seeking $50 million from Wirtz to help fund a new $150 million elementary school, while Wirtz’s legal team has countered with an estimate closer to $5 million.\nIn recent weeks, tensions have spilled into the public. School officials accused the village of sidelining them during negotiations and criticized Wirtz for underestimating the project’s potential strain on schools.\nMundelein Mayor Steve Lentz responded by accusing the districts of trying to “embarrass” the high-profile Wirtz family into paying more than what Illinois law requires. Lentz also emphasized that municipalities, not school districts, are responsible for negotiating impact fees.\n",

    "content": "Related California plans to build a 41-story office building and hotel in San Francisco while nearly two out of five city workplaces sit empty.\nFor the Irvine-based developer, it’s all in how you crunch the numbers for the proposed office-hotel tower at 530 Sansome Street, in the North Financial District across from the Transamerica Pyramid near Jackson Square,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nYes, overall office vacancy across the city hovers at a dismal 37 percent.  Yes, the top five buildings have a 16 percent vacancy.\nBut when you pull away the drapes, the city’s true office trophies with views from the Golden Gate to the Bay Bridge command a vacancy of 6.9 percent — the target for the Related venture.\n“Right building in the right location at the right time,” Matt Witte, executive vice president of acquisitions and development for Related California, told the Chronicle.\n“This started out as a contrarian bet but as we dug in deeper and looked at the market, how it is evolving and maturing out of COVID, it doesn’t seem so contrarian any more,” added Gino Canori, president of Related California. “It’s a story about San Francisco’s recovery, about the city coming out of a tough time and building something everyone can be proud of.”\nPlans call for a 544-foot tower with 360,000 square feet of offices atop a five-star, 200-room hotel, plus a new firehouse at 447 Battery Street to replace a station swallowed up by the project. A previous 19-story hotel and fitness club project, approved in 2021, stalled.\nThe city is expected to publish an environmental study on Tuesday, March 11. Related hopes to secure approvals to build the tower this fall, allowing the firm to break ground by late next year. If all goes well, the gleaming glass rectangle could be completed by 2030.\nIt would be the first new North Financial District building since 350 Bush Street opened in 2018, and the first new five-star hotel in 30 years, according to the Chronicle. It’s expected to cost\n$600 million\n.\n\nThe tower, designed by Chicago-based SOM, would anchor a block across from the Transamerica Pyramid, which New York-based Michael Shvo revamped, investing $1 billion. Rents for top-floor offices in the area are north of $200 a square foot, more than three times the city average.\nIt would also be built next to Jackson Square — the hot spot in San Francisco’s glacial rebound.\nRelated California, a unit of New York-based Related Companies, “did a lot of homework,” touring buildings and digging into leasing data, Canori said.\nAs it hoovered up information, it grew convinced there was demand for a new building with “killer views” and features that top tenants want  — meeting rooms and workout facilities and outside terraces and swank restaurants.\nSuch amenities not only help recruit and retain talent. They attract them to a return-to-office.\nThree North Financial District tenants have leases expiring in 2030 who are “taking a very close look” at the proposed building, Canori told the newspaper, which “is further emboldening our ability to press ahead with getting the project approved and started.\n“We think the market is there,” he declared.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "content": "Two new long-term retail leases have been signed at Mission Rock, and a long-awaited French bakery has opened its doors in the development.\nBlue Bottle Coffee and Sweetgreen have both signed 10-year leases at the 28-acre Mission Bay development, which is owned by the Port of San Francisco and was formerly a parking lot for the Giants, according to a news release Tuesday from developers Tishman Speyer and the San Francisco Giants.\nThe development team is now wrapping up its first phase with two apartment buildings and two office towers, one of which is Visa’s market support center, which provides resources for the credit card company’s clients and businesses globally.\nOakland-founded Blue Bottle will occupy 2,069 square feet at the base of the Visa building at 300 Toni Stone Crossing. The 13-story tower houses nearly 1,000 Visa employees, according to the company’s website.\nSalad and grain bowl shop Sweetgreen will take just under 2,400 square feet at the base of The Canyon, a residential tower at the intersection of Dr. Maya Angelou Lane and Toni Strone Crossing. A representative for Tishman Speyer said that the developer anticipates both Sweetgreen and Blue Bottle will be submitting their permits shortly. The rep declined to give any further information on tenant improvement allowances or lease terms.\nCBRE’s Alex Sagues and Madeline Mandanis represented Mission Rock Partners. Blue Bottle was represented by Benzi Blatman with CBRE, while Sweetgreen was represented by AJ Schrader with Tier One Retail Group.\nSagues called Mission Bay “the most vibrant neighborhood in San Francisco.” He said retailers are drawn to the transit-friendly area because “it is a true seven-day neighborhood,” with office, life science, residential, and the UCSF hospital, as well as events at Chase Center and Oracle Park.\nBeloved French bakery Arsicault, known as much for its long lines as its buttery pastries, was announced as a retail tenant in Mission Rock\nin the summer of 2023\nand just opened this week. It is the San Francisco pastry-makers’ third location, after expanding from its original location in the Inner Richmond into Civic Center in 2020. It signed a 10-year lease for nearly 2,500 square feet at the base of the Verde apartment tower in Mission Bay, according to the developers. At least to start, its Mission Rock offerings will be the same as at their other locations.\n\n“Our bakery honors traditional pastry-making techniques while Mission Rock represents San Francisco’s vibrant future,” Arsicault owner Armando Lacayo said in a statement. “The combination feels perfect for this community where tradition and innovation blend together seamlessly.”\nIn a statement, San Francisco Giants vice president of real estate development Julian Pancoast called the arrival of Arsicault, and signing of Blue Bottle and Sweetgreen leases, “exceptional additions” that were “carefully selected” to “enhance our vision of being a welcoming destination for all to enjoy.”\nA Giants representative added that it is important to “curate” a variety of brands and concepts for the neighborhood to hit a wide range of price points and tastes.\n“Our goal is to create a dynamic retail ecosystem that supports daily residents and office users while making Mission Rock a destination people visit often, for a variety of experiences,” the rep said via email.\nAdditional retailers will continue to be announced on a rolling basis, according to the press release. So far, much like Arsicault, the strategy seems to be to bring in mostly local brands with an avid following, but without a Mission Bay presence.\nIke’s Love &amp; Sandwiches, LuxFit gym and Proper Food all opened in Mission Rock last summer. The first permanent outpost of Quik Dog, a burger restaurant that began during the pandemic as a temporary-take out window at renowned Mission cocktail bar Trick Dog, will also open in the coming months. So will Flour + Water Pizza Shop, and a full-service restaurant from the team behind Che Fico on Divisadero. The new Che Fico restaurant will presumably have more offerings than the Che Fico Pizzeria that opened blocks away at Chase Center’s Thrive City last fall.\nIt’s not the only crossover between the Golden Gate Warriors’ home stadium and Mission Rock. The Warriors confirmed that the team\nwould be taking 71,000 square feet\nin Mission Rock’s Building B. It was the first lease signed in the nearly 300,000-square-foot building, which was\nbuilt as life sciences space\nbefore pivoting back to traditional office space.\n",

The cost: $125 million.\nTo move forward, the county said last week it needed two documents from the would-be buyer: a quit-claim deed and a release related to litigation,\nthe San Francisco Business Times reported\n.\nCounty Supervisor David Haubert\ntold Fox2 KTVU on Friday\nthe documents were received, signaling a big step forward in the sale.\nThe county also expected to get them in time to approve a sale on Tuesday, March 11.\nThe county had asked the entertainment group to hold a $100 million insurance policy to cover unspecified costs after closing. The entertainment group made a counter offer to hold a $30 million policy for the next two years, which the county had yet to accept late last week.\nCity staff were concerned that a paperwork delay could cause investors to pull their funding and kill the redevelopment deal. The entertainment group and Loop Capital, a major Black-owned investment firm based in Chicago, could not be reached by the Business Times for comment.\n\nCounty negotiators said they had expected to have the required paperwork to allow for final approval from supervisors on Tuesday,\naccording to the San Francisco Chronicle\n.\nThe Coliseum complex includes the stadium, the arena, administrative offices and acres of parking. The entertainment group’s proposed\n$5 billion redevelopment\nproject calls for homes, hotels, a convention center, youth amphitheater, restaurants and museums, while retaining the aging stadium.\nIn 2019, the A’s bought the county’s share of the site for $85 million, and were in the process of paying for it when the team left Oakland for Las Vegas.\nIn July, the entertainment group agreed to buy the city’s share of the Coliseum property for\n$105 million\n.\nIn August, the MLB franchise struck a deal with the entertainment group to sell its stake for\n$125 million\n, which required final approval by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

The six-story studio offices would contain floor-to-ceiling windows and broad white eaves, supported by round vertical pillars, according to a rendering.\nPending approvals, Prologis would break ground in 2027 and be completed by 2029.\nPrologis bought the former bus terminal in 2021 for\n$91 million\n.

    "content": "A Spanish-style mansion in a gated Laguna Niguel community sold for $16.3 million, marking a new record for the city.\nThe sale of 7 Searidge beats out the city’s previous all-time residential high of $15 million for a two-lot transaction at 6 Inspiration that closed in 2014.\nPhillip Caruso, the lead listing agent and part of Christie’s International Real Estate Southern California, said the best comparable to 7 Searidge may be an off-market deal for a 14,000-square-foot home recorded in the same community of Bear Brand Ranch that traded for $12 million in 2015, but there are no other details beyond that.\nCaruso listed the property with his father, Michael Caruso. Their group\njoined Christie’s International Real Estate Southern California\nlast year.\nThe seller was an out-of-state land developer who the Carusos have counted as a long-time client. The mystery buyer was represented by Pacific Sotheby’s International Realty’s AJ Olson Whitfield.\nPhillip Caruso pointed out 7 Searidge still beats out all records in the city on a price-per-square-foot basis, in which the deal penciled out to $1,993 per square foot. That beats out the city’s former record set in 2014, which equated to $625 per square foot.\n“This is an incredible achievement, especially when considering economies of scale,” Caruso said in an email to\nThe Real Deal\n. “Typically, as homes get larger in size, the price per square foot goes down, and as homes are smaller, price per square foot goes up. To be the highest ever in any size home is a testament to the quality, design, build, style and the marketing of this home.”\n\nHomes penciling out to $2,000 per square foot are typically in\nNewport Beach\nor coastal markets, Caruso pointed out.\nThe home on Searidge was designed by Spectrum Architecture and built by Elevated Building Group, with an interior designed by Laura Brophy of Brophy Interiors.\nIt’s a couple miles from the beach, has six bedrooms, eight bathrooms and totals over 8,000 square feet. Among the home’s highlights are a media room, gym, private courtyard, infinity pool, gardens and outdoor kitchen.\nThe purchase price reflects an increase from the just under $16 million listing price, which Caruso attributed to the city’s proximity to several major retail projects.\nThat includes the recently opened\nRiver Street Marketplace\nin San Juan Capistrano and the in-progress revitalization of Dana Point Harbor, which began about a year ago.\n“These are definitely helping to attract a buyer demographic who appreciates more retail and community lifestyle in their locales,” Caruso said. “I have helped numerous clients purchase homes and move from L.A. [and] Newport Beach to Laguna Niguel. You can achieve more on a purchase [or] lease in terms of size, quality and amenities. More bang for your buck.”\nPrices in the city spiked in January more than 40 percent compared to a year earlier, reaching a median price of $1.7 million, according to the most recent data from Redfin.\n",

    "content": "SummerHill Homes got the nod to replace a historic lodge in Los Gatos with 155 townhomes.\nThe San Ramon-based developer was approved by the Los Gatos Town Council to build the three-story development at 50 Los Gatos-Saratoga Road,\nthe San Jose Spotlight reported\n.\nThe 128-room Los Gatos Lodge, which opened 1958, will be demolished.\nPlans for the project, filed in 2023, call for 155 townhomes across 8.8 acres, of which 26 would be set aside as affordable. Parking would accommodate 330 cars.\nIn January, a typical home in the town south of San Jose sold for $2.5 million, up 39.7 percent from a year earlier,\naccording to Redfin\n. Rob Moore, vice mayor for Los Gatos, said the new townhomes would allow people like him a shot at owning a home.\n“I’m one of the one-third of renters that lives in the town of Los Gatos who, as it currently stands, does not have a pathway to home ownership in this town,” he told the council. “When I see this sort of development where these units are likely to go for less than a single-family home goes for in Los Gatos, I see a place where I could see myself potentially living one day.”\nThe Planning Commission\nunanimously recommended\nthe project’s approval last month. SummerHill applied under SB 330, which fast-tracks approvals for cities that are out of compliance with state-\nmandated housing plans\n.\nThe developer could have invoked the\nbuilder’s remedy\n, a legal loophole in state housing law that allows developers to bypass local zoning rules in cities that haven’t certified their housing element plans, providing they include enough affordable housing, according to the Spotlight.\n\nBut the unit of Calabasas-based Marcus &amp; Millichap didn’t in an effort to work with the town.\nThe town must plan to build 1,993 homes by 2031, 847 of which must be affordable to low-income residents.\nThe developer expects to break ground this year, with model homes expected to be built by summer 2027.\nJohn Hickey, vice president of development at SummerHill, said project amenities will help future residents, as well as the surrounding neighborhood. SummerHill Homes has also built the homes at\nBellaterra @ North 40\n, in Los Gatos.\nSummerHil, founded in 1976, has developed more than 7,000 homes in the Bay Area and Southern California, according to its LinkedIn page.\nLast month, the firm partnered with the Houston-based Hanover Company, which paid\n$78.3 million\nfor a century-old fruit stand and orchard at 2620 Seely Avenue in San Jose, with plans to build more than 1,600 homes.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

    "pub_date_dt": "2025-03-10T18:09:00",
    "content": "Alexander Mehran Jr. is the\nthird generation of his family\nto run the Sunset Development Company, the San Ramon-based developer and owner behind the 585-acre Bishop Ranch office park, about an hour east of San Francisco. But even though he grew up in the office development world and has been at Sunset Development since 2009, following a stint in New York at Goldman Sachs, Mehran told\nThe Real Deal\nhe still can’t predict what will happen in the Bay Area’s uncertain office market.\n“I threw a dart at the wall,” he joked, when explaining how he decided which of his family’s office properties should be razed to create 300,000 square feet of retail and entertainment at Bishop Ranch’s CityCenter, which opened in 2018, as well as 8,000 planned new housing units.\n“It’s roughly half of what we had,” he said of the company’s current 8 million square feet of commercial space. “It’s the best stuff. I think that as [we] move forward, more people will want to be here. That’s a complete guess. I have no idea.”\nBut Mehran said he is sure that adding a residential component — including a recently opened 177-unit luxury senior assisted living facility from Belmont Village and 404 for-sale single-family homes and duplexes by SummerHill Homes — will be “accretive” to the rest of the community, even if it also means giving up some long-held control.\n“I know that adding people is going to drive the place forward,” he said. “I know that some people have to be owners, and that’s a scary thing. We’ve only had a handful of owners for 40 years here: Chevron, Toyota, Pac Bell and us.”\nSunset sold land to Chevron and Pacific Bell in the early 1980s only to buy it back as both companies downsized and relocated over the last decade. PacBell, now AT&amp;T, sold its 1.8 million-square-foot former headquarters for $250 million in 2014 and Chevron followed, selling its over 1 million-square-foot headquarters\nfor $175 million in 2022\n.\nToday, both are tenants in the former PacBell space, which is now dubbed Lakeside as it overlooks the man-made Annabel Lake. Since the pandemic, AT&amp;T has listed\nlarge subleases\non the 900,000 square feet they agreed to lease back at Lakeside as part of the sale. The former Chevron HQ is now called The Orchards, and the 92-acre property is working its way through the planning process to\nbecome a mix of office, retail and 2,500 new homes\n.\nThe dramatic downsize from two of Bishop Ranch’s biggest players is indicative of broader market trends, and Mehran said developers and owners need to accept that the time where companies were wowed by full-building opportunities is likely coming to a close. When HR firm Robert Half moved from its own 250,000-square-foot building at Bishop Ranch to 70,000 square feet in Lakeside, that was “a big blow,” he said. But he also wasn’t waiting around for another single company to take its place.\n“Strategically, it’s pretty easy for me to just cut it up and multitenant it,” he said, adding that these days having a completely empty office building isn’t exactly a strong calling card. “If you’re walking around with a customer and you’re like, ‘Oh we’ve got this whole building,’ it’s like, ‘Whoa, these guys are in trouble.’”\n\nSunset has also recently begun turning empty offices into turnkey spec suites, which can have lease terms for as short as one year. Mehran said they have rented quickly even at a $1 per-square-foot premium. He’d rather take the shorter-term lease, but put in finishes he knows many tenants will like, instead of something bespoke for a tenant who eventually moves on.\n“I’ve just seen a lot of customers build things that don’t matter in five years or don’t really provide value,” he said.\nSunset is also transforming other underutilized spaces into amenities like gyms, restaurants and coffee spots. Flourish opened in The Orchards last fall and the cafe-style coworking space has everything from private Zoom rooms to conference and collaboration space, as well as a full coffee bar, breakfast and lunch menus, and evening events. Another Flourish with a plant theme is already in the works in the Sycamore office complex of Bishop Ranch and will open in the near future.\n“What I learned with the big building, Lakeside, was if you don’t have things like this people don’t want to be there,” Mehran said.\nSome may want the gourmet coffee experience, others the extra conference space or the ability to entertain clients. Whatever tenants need, Mehran wants to be able to provide it because in today’s highly competitive office world, he said, developers can’t risk being caught without everything on tenants’ lengthy checklists.\n“It’s a binary thing,” he said. “It’s between a one and a zero of, ‘Am I going to sign a lease and have an office or am I not?’” he said.\nChanging Bishop Ranch also means finding new financing partners “who believe in you and allow you to make that shift,” Mehran said. Sunset has a long-standing relationship with Wells Fargo, which financed its purchase of Lakeside and the development of CityCenter, but it recently broadened to CitiGroup and Comerica, Mehran said.\nIt’s not easy getting a loan on offices, given the level of distress in the space and “it takes a long time for fear to exit these institutions,” Mehran said. But the new leases he’s been signing since 2022 seem like strong indications that people are figuring out their post-pandemic requirements, he said.\nIn all the uncertainty, Mehran said he’s keeping his eye on the long term, since that’s what Sunset does best.\n“I like progress,” he said. “We have a lot of energy behind us and what we’re doing is very tricky and has consequences for the next many, many decades. But we have a really thoughtful team and I believe in it.”\n",

    "content": "Storefronts in historic Jackson Square are hot — and a luxury alternative to Union Square.\nWhile Ralph Lauren has returned to San Francisco with a new store at 441 Jackson Street, restaurateur Peter Hemsley and the Brick &amp; Timber Collective have paid $32.4 million for a 15,600-square-foot store and building at 530 Jackson Street, the\nSan Francisco Chronicle\nand the\nSan Francisco Business Times\nreported.\nThe tony district that harkens back to the Gold Rush has seen an\ninflux of luxury retailers\nlike Paul Smith, Isabel Marant and Zimmermann. At the same time, many retailers have left nearby Union Square, with an\nexit planned by Macy’s\n.\nNew York-based Ralph Lauren had a store at 2040 Fillmore Street, which closed in 2020.  It also had a location in the\nCrocker Galleria\nthat shuttered in 2013.\nIts new store, which replaces a Senreve apparel shop, was designed to reflect the rich history of Jackson Square, with a contemporary twist, an unidentified Ralph Lauren spokesperson told the Chronicle. It’s dark green, with hand-painted gold leaf and brass signs, along with stained oak floors and white-painted brick walls.\nTerms of the lease, as well as the owner of the building, were not disclosed.\n“The opening of Polo Ralph Lauren in Jackson Square is a testament to the neighborhood’s growing appeal as a premier destination for retail,” Robbie Silver, CEO of the Downtown SF Partnership,\nsaid in a statement\n.\nIt was Hemsley who announced last year he would shut down the Michelin-starred Aphotic, pointing the blame squarely to its location in South of Market.\n“There are few left in San Francisco that aspire to provide services like we do at Aphotic, and the smart and lucky ones in the pack are located in the right storefront, on the right block, and in the right part of town,” he wrote on Instagram.\nNow Hemsley seems to have found that right location.\n\nIn a deal that closed last week, he and the locally based Brick &amp; Timber bought the Jackson Street storefront a block from the Ralph Lauren shop for $2,075 per square foot, the Business Times reported, citing public records and unidentified sources.\nThe seller of the four-story office and retail building was the McAleese family, which has run the former Kells Irish Pub and Restaurant and occupied its ground floor for more than two decades.\nBrick &amp; Timber plans to revamp the building, and keep it for the long haul, according to founder Glenn Gilmore.\nPartner Jesse Feldman described Hemsley as “a world-class culinary talent,” and said the pair mutually felt the building would serve as “a special location for the next chapter in his story,” according to a statement.\nIt’s not clear whether the chef intends to revive Aphotic, or launch a new restaurant.\nJackson Square has emerged as a bright spot in Downtown San Francisco. Former Apple designer Jony Ive has\nspent almost $100 million\nbuying up buildings in the area. There’s also Michael Shvo’s $1 billion bet on the Transamerica Pyramid.\nBrick &amp; Timber, founded in 2013 by Glenn Gilmore, developed its chops\nturning Gold Rush-era warehouses into offices for venture capitalists\nalong the North Waterfront. With nine buildings in Jackson Square, the Jackson Square-based collective is “arguably the predominant real estate investor” in the North Waterfront, partner Jesse Feldman\ntold The Real Deal last month\n.\nIn December, the firm bought an eight-story 115,600-square-foot building at 500 Washington Street for $32.7 million, or $282 per square foot,\nTRD reported.\n—\nDana Bartholomew\n",

It sold for $1,870 per square foot and is the priciest home to sell in Chicago this year.\nIt hit the market\nin July for $10.8 million\n, about $2,000 per square foot, and found a buyer within two months but took six months to close.\nSellers Bruce and Kate Carbonari bought the entire 23rd floor as raw space for $6.7 million in 2016 and spent at least $1.5 million into the buildout, permit records show.\nThey bought when the building was new; the 194,000-square-foot tower at 4 East Elm was completed in 2016 and designed by SCB. It holds only two units per floor, ranging between 3,100 and 3,500 square feet and each is served by its own private elevator, according to SCB’s website.\nThe Carbonaris decided to sell after spending more time in Detroit with their grandchildren and at their Florida home. Bruce retired as Fortune Brands chairman and CEO after 22 years in 2011.\nSharon O’Hara and Carrie McCormick represented the sellers, and Emily Sachs Wong represented the buyers, all with @properties Christie’s International Real Estate. The buyer wasn’t identified.\nThe Carbonaris redesigned the living room and adjacent balcony to create an indoor-outdoor space featuring a 12-foot-high glass wall and french doors.\n\nThe result is a panoramic view spanning Chicago’s skyline, Lake Michigan and the surrounding neighborhoods. Additional terraces occupy the building’s northeast and northwest corners, with about 1,700 square feet of outdoor space.\nDowntown condos have accounted for eight of the top 10 highest-priced home sales in the Chicago area this year before counting two $12 million mansions and another $35 million home in Winnetka, which went under contract last week and in early February, respectively.\nChicago’s luxury condo market is\nshowing early signs of a rebound\nafter years of sluggish sales.\nUltra-high-end buyers have been selective, gravitating toward properties that avoid the stigma of long market stays or bulk sales.\nNewer projects, like Crescent Heights, at 850 Lake Shore Drive, have gained traction by pricing units competitively, while older developments like the St. Regis have struggled with slower sales and bulk transactions.\nSo far, 21 homes have sold for $4 million or more this year, outpacing the 16 sold by this time last year.\n— Judah Duke\n",

    "content": "In Winnetka’s residential market, eight-figure deals are coming in waves.\nTwo $12 million sales landed within just eight days of each other, the latest in a hot streak for the ultra-luxury market in the lakefront Chicago suburb, Crain’s\nreported\n.\nBoth homes are on Sheridan Road and have 100-foot wide private Lake Michigan beachfronts. They are among the priciest deals in the area this year, along with a $35 million mansion that went under contract in early February.\nThe 9,650-square-foot, seven-bedroom home at 973 Sheridan Road, was built five years ago on about 2 acres. It was listed on Feb. 15 and went under contract in 12 days. The asking price came to $1,245 per square foot.\nBuilt in 2020 by Paul Konstant and Scott Lyon &amp; Company, the two-story mansion has an elevator, a sports court, golf simulator, home theater, playroom with bunk room and a guest house with designated parking.\nThe land was purchased for $6.19 million in 2017 by a trust associated with Luke and Margaret Kelly. Agents Cricket King and John Baylor with @properties Christie’s International Real Estate had the listing.\nThe mansion at 765 Sheridan Road was built in 2005. The 15,800-square-foot, seven-bedroom home includes a pool and spa, stone terraces, an outdoor kitchen, gym, bar and elevator. It asked about $760 per square foot.\n\nIt initially hit the market in August for $18 million. After a price drop to just under $15 million, sellers Morris Silverman and Lori Komisar switched agents to Jena Radnay of @properties Christie’s and reduced the price to just under $12 million.\nThis year’s highest-priced home sales so far include two downtown Chicago condos in the $8.9 million range at\nthe St. Regis\non the Chicago River and One Chicago at Chicago Avenue and State Street.\nTwo Winnetka homes sold for over $12 million in 2023, and one in 2022, when billionaire private equity executive Justin Ishiba assembled a $39.9 million site for a\nmansion projected to cost over $44 million\nto build.\nAnother Winnetka home, which hit the market Friday, is asking $10.3 million ($1,275 per square foot) at 381 Sheridan Road.\nBuilt in 2015, that 8,000-square-foot home has six bedrooms, a theater room, sports simulator, home gym, two spa baths and two walk-in closets. It has an outdoor kitchen, an 88-foot wide private beach and a 3-car garage.\nThe sellers are Thomas and Amy Day, Cook County records show. Radnay has the listing.\n— Judah Duke\n",
